7	Manhattan Project. The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons. It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

12	Tutorial: Introduction to Restorative Justice. Restorative justice is a theory of justice that emphasizes repairing the harm caused by criminal behaviour. It is best accomplished through cooperative processes that include all stakeholders. This can lead to transformation of people, relationships and communities. Practices and programs reflecting restorative purposes will respond to crime by: 1  identifying and taking steps to repair harm, 2  involving all stakeholders, and. 3  transforming the traditional relationship between communities and their governments in responding to crime.
13	Organize volunteer community panels, boards, or committees that meet with the offender to discuss the incident and offender obligation to repair the harm to victims and community members. Facilitate the process of apologies to victims and communities. Invite local victim advocates to provide ongoing victim-awareness training for probation staff.
14	The purpose of this paper is to point out a number of unresolved issues in the criminal justice system, present the underlying principles of restorative justice, and then to review the growing amount of empirical data on victim-offender mediation.
15	Each of these types of communitiesâthe geographic community of the victim, offender, or crime; the community of care; and civil societyâmay be injured by crime in different ways and degrees, but all will be affected in common ways as well: The sense of safety and confidence of their members is threatened, order within the community is threatened, and (depending on the kind of crime) common values of the community are challenged and perhaps eroded.
16	The approach is based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offense against an individual or community, rather than the State. Restorative justice that fosters dialogue between victim and offender has shown the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability.
17	Inherent in many peopleâs understanding of the notion of ADR is the existence of a dispute between identifiable parties. Criminal justice, however, is not usually conceptualised as a dispute between victim and offender, but is instead seen as a matter concerning the relationship between the offender and the state. This raises a complex question as to whether a criminal offence can properly be described as a âdisputeâ.

19	The circle includes a wide range of participants including not only the offender and the victim but also friends and families, community members, and justice system representatives. The primary distinction between conferencing and circles is that circles do not focus exclusively on the offense and do not limit their solutions to repairing the harm between the victim and the offender.

21	Phloem and xylem are complex tissues that perform transportation of food and water in a plant. They are the vascular tissues of the plant and together form vascular bundles. They work together as a unit to bring about effective transportation of food, nutrients, minerals and water.

23	Phloem is a conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant.
24	Unlike xylem (which is composed primarily of dead cells), the phloem is composed of still-living cells that transport sap. The sap is a water-based solution, but rich in sugars made by the photosynthetic areas.
25	In xylem vessels water travels by bulk flow rather than cell diffusion. In phloem, concentration of organic substance inside a phloem cell (e.g., leaf) creates a diffusion gradient by which water flows into cells and phloem sap moves from source of organic substance to sugar sinks by turgor pressure.
26	The mechanism by which sugars are transported through the phloem, from sources to sinks, is called pressure flow. At the sources (usually the leaves), sugar molecules are moved into the sieve elements (phloem cells) through active transport.
27	Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant. â¦ The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals from the roots is called the xylem.
28	Xylem transports water and soluble mineral nutrients from roots to various parts of the plant. It is responsible for replacing water lost through transpiration and photosynthesis. Phloem translocates sugars made by photosynthetic areas of plants to storage organs like roots, tubers or bulbs.
29	At this time the Industrial Workers of the World had a membership of over 100,000 members. In 1913 William Haywood replaced Vincent Saint John as secretary-treasurer of the Industrial Workers of the World. By this time, the IWW had 100,000 members.
30	This was not true of the Industrial Workers of the World and as a result many of its members were first and second generation immigrants. Several immigrants such as Mary 'Mother' Jones, Hubert Harrison, Carlo Tresca, Arturo Giovannitti and Joe Haaglund Hill became leaders of the organization.
31	Chinese Immigration and the Chinese Exclusion Acts. In the 1850s, Chinese workers migrated to the United States, first to work in the gold mines, but also to take agricultural jobs, and factory work, especially in the garment industry.
32	The Rise of Industrial America, 1877-1900. When in 1873 Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner entitled their co-authored novel The Gilded Age, they gave the late nineteenth century its popular name. The term reflected the combination of outward wealth and dazzle with inner corruption and poverty.
33	American objections to Chinese immigration took many forms, and generally stemmed from economic and cultural tensions, as well as ethnic discrimination. Most Chinese laborers who came to the United States did so in order to send money back to China to support their families there.
34	The rise of industrial America, the dominance of wage labor, and the growth of cities represented perhaps the greatest changes of the period. Few Americans at the end of the Civil War had anticipated the rapid rise of American industry.
35	The resulting Angell Treaty permitted the United States to restrict, but not completely prohibit, Chinese immigration. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which, per the terms of the Angell Treaty, suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers (skilled or unskilled) for a period of 10 years.
36	Industrial Workers of the World. In 1905 representatives of 43 groups who opposed the policies of American Federation of Labour, formed the radical labour organisation, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The IWW's goal was to promote worker solidarity in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the employing class.
37	The railroads powered the industrial economy. They consumed the majority of iron and steel produced in the United States before 1890. As late as 1882, steel rails accounted for 90 percent of the steel production in the United States. They were the nationâs largest consumer of lumber and a major consumer of coal.
38	This finally resulted in legislation that aimed to limit future immigration of Chinese workers to the United States, and threatened to sour diplomatic relations between the United States and China.

49	Colorâurine can be a variety of colors, most often shades of yellow, from very pale or colorless to very dark or amber. Unusual or abnormal urine colors can be the result of a disease process, several medications (e.g., multivitamins can turn urine bright yellow), or the result of eating certain foods.
50	I had 3 cups of coffee and a red bull today all in 4 hours. The first time I urinated, it was an amber color. Then I got worried and drank a lot of water and now my urine is back to normal (light yellow). This only happened once after drinking all that caffeine.

51	During the visual examination of the urine, the laboratorian observes the urine's color and clarity. These can be signs of what substances may be present in the urine. They are interpreted in conjunction with results obtained during the chemical and microscopic examinations to confirm what substances are present.
52	But the basic details of your urine -- color, smell, and how often you go -- can give you a hint about whatâs going on inside your body. Pee is your bodyâs liquid waste, mainly made of water, salt, and chemicals called urea and uric acid. Your kidneys make it when they filter toxins and other bad stuff from your blood.
53	However, red-colored urine can also occur when blood is present in the urine and can be an indicator of disease or damage to some part of the urinary system. Another example is yellow-brown or greenish-brown urine that may be a sign of bilirubin in the urine (see The Chemical Examination section).
54	The shade, light or dark, also changes. If it has no color at all, that may be because youâve been drinking a lot of water or taking a drug called a diuretic, which helps your body get rid of fluid. Very dark honey- or brown-colored urine could be a sign that youâre dehydrated and need to get more fluids right away.
55	A good rule of thumb is the darker your urine, the more water you need to drink. And if your urine is any other color besides a various shade of yellow (which weâll get into down below) something may be wrong.
56	Color, density, and smell can reveal health problems. Human urine has been a useful tool of diagnosis since the earliest days of medicine.

69	However, a major motive with people today wanting to use the barley harvest to determine the start of the year is to justify starting the year AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE, frequently even before the end of winter. That is in fact the opposite of what the Talmud records the leaders of the Sanhedrin occasionally doing ...
70	Some people claim that the timing of the barley harvest in Israel should be the deciding factor as to when to start the new year for determining the observance of God's annual Feasts and Holy Days.
71	Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain. It was one of the first cultivated grains and is now grown widely. Barley grain is a staple in Tibetan cuisine and was eaten widely by peasants in Medieval Europe. Barley has also been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods.
72	The state of the barley harvest could PERHAPS cause the start of a year to be postponed to THE FOLLOWING NEW MOON (thereby giving the previous year a 13th month), but the state of the barley harvest could NEVER DETERMINE THAT AN EARLIER NEW MOON SHOULD BE USED TO START THE YEAR!
73	The grape harvest was usually completed before Tabernacles, but most of the olive harvest came after the autumn festivals. In ancient Israel the primary harvest season extended from April to November. This harvest period might be subdivided into three seasons and three major crops: the spring grain harvest, the summer grape harvest and the autumn olive harvest.
74	Barley is not as cold tolerant as the winter wheats (Triticum aestivum), fall rye (Secale cereale) or winter triticale (Ã Triticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus.), but may be sown as a winter crop in warmer areas of Australia and Great Britain. Barley has a short growing season and is also relatively drought tolerant.
75	âWheat ripens later than barley and, according to the Gezer Manual, was harvested during the sixth agricultural season, yrh qsr wkl (end of April to end of May)â (page 88; also see the chart on page 37 of Borowskiâs book, reproduced below).
76	That claim is obviously not correct. God did not hinge the start of a new year on the state of the barley crop, even if on occasions in the first and second centuries A.D. the pharisaical leaders of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem decided to use the state of the barley harvest to start a new year one new moon later.
77	Barley is always sown in the autumn, after the early rains, and the barley harvest, which for any given locality precedes the wheat harvest (Exodus 9:31 f), begins near Jericho in April--or even March--but in the hill country of Palestine is not concluded until the end of May or beginning of June.
78	Pentecost, near the end of the grain harvest, included grain and loaf offerings (verses 16-17). Pentecost was also called âthe Feast of Harvestâ (Exodus 23:16). Barley and wheat were planted in the autumn and ripened in spring. Barley matured faster and would be harvested sooner. The firstfruits of grain offered during the Festival of Unleavened Bread would have been barley.
79	There are however some very serious illnesses that can cause this pain in left side under ribs. These would include pneumothorax, pancreatitis, and dissection of the abdominal aorta. It could also be a spleen disorder, kidney stones, or pericardritis (inflammation of the heart sac).
80	Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas and can be caused by eating very fatty foods. If the left side pain under ribs is caused by a dissection of the abdominal aorta, your life is in immediate danger. Dying from an internal hemorrhage is the major risk involved in this situation.
81	What organs are on your left side of body. Causes of Pain under Left Rib Cage. Here are just some of the possible reasons why you may be feeling pain under your left rib cage: Gas Stuck in the Colon â There is a chance that you have gas stuck in your colon. The amount of gas that is stuck may be excessive.
82	For the individual bones, see Rib. For ribs of animals as food, see Ribs (food). For other uses, see Rib (disambiguation). The rib cage is an arrangement of bones in the thorax of all vertebrates except the lamprey and the frog. It is formed by the vertebral column, ribs, and sternum and encloses the heart and lungs.
83	If the lower set of ribs on the right side of the rib cage get damaged due to an injury, then one is likely to experience a sharp pain under the right rib cage. If the pain worsens when one tries to bend or twist the body, then an X-ray examination should be conducted to study the extent of damage to the ribs.
84	Vital organs such as heart and lungs are protected by the rib cage. Under the rib cage lie many organs that form a part of the abdomen. Most of the organs that lie in the abdominal region are a part of the digestive system. These include the liver, gallbladder, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, stomach, small intestine and the large intestine.
85	The only organs contained in the chest cavity are the lungs and the heart. Obviously, one of the lungs is under the left rib cage, and then the heart is also found here. The oâ¦nly other part of the chest cavity to be noted would be the diaphragm, which aids a person's breathing. 4 people found this useful.
86	Usually, you can feel the pain reverberating from the upper portion of the left side of your abdomen towards the left side of your ribcage. Irritation on the Spleen â There is a chance that your spleen has already ruptured because of various reasons and this can cause some pains on the left rib cage.
87	Each rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft, and they are numbered from top to bottom. The head of rib is the end part closest to the spine with which it articulates. It is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface which is divided by a horizontal crest into two facets.
88	With either of these there is a fairly simple medication treatment. There is also the possibility that gas is caught in the colon. This is even less serious that acid reflux and does not require medication to resolve it. Sharp pain left side under ribs might come from a condition called costochondritis.

133	An RAPD is a defect in the direct response. It is due to damage in optic nerve or severe retinal disease. It is important to be able to differentiate whether a patient is complaining of decreased vision from an ocular problem such as cataract or from a defect of the optic nerve.
134	abnormal pupillary reflex means. If this doesn't happen, it could mean that either the retina or optic nerve is damaged, or the visceromotor output pathway from the oculomotor nerve is not working. This type of response indicates ipsilateral issues.
135	The physiology behind a normal pupillary constriction is a balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Parasympathetic innervation leads to pupillary constriction. A circular muscle called the sphincter pupillae accomplishes this task. The fibers of the sphincter pupillae encompass the pupil.
136	1. These are the pupillary reflexes mediated through the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system; 2. the ciliospinal reflex which tests pupillary responses mediated through the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system, and 3. the salivary reflex which is also parasympathetic.

149	Oral Phase. The first phase of swallowing is the oral phase which involves the tongue, mandible, lips, cheeks and palate all working together to ensure the food is adequately prepared for the future stages. In this phase, food is mixed with saliva and chewed with the aid of the muscles of mastication.
150	Swallowing is a complex act that involves the coordinated activity of the mouth, pharynx, larynx and esophagus (Figure 1). A swallow has four phases: oral preparatory, oral propulsive, pharyngeal and esophageal.3.
151	Stages of the Swallow. (Logemann, 1983, 1989,1997; Cherney, 1994) The oral preparatory phase. This part of the swallow is voluntary. It is a mechanical phase that can be by-passed by dropping liquid or food into the back of the throat. In this stage, the food is chewed into smaller pieces and tasted.
152	-purpose: to move food from the front of the oral cavity to the anterior faucial arches, where the reflexive swallow is initiated. -Less than one second in duration. -Bolus passes posteriorly in the oral cavity to the faucial pillars. -CNs V, VII, IX, X, XI and XII.
153	Article Sections. Swallowing disorders are common, especially in the elderly, and may cause dehydration, weight loss, aspiration pneumonia and airway obstruction. These disorders may affect the oral preparatory, oral propulsive, pharyngeal and/or esophageal phases of swallowing.
154	Dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing, is not a disease in itself but a condition that can be brought on by many different causes because swallowing is a delicate process, easily disturbed. Some causes are minor and quickly treatable; others are serious, even life-threatening.
155	The coupling of the findings of diminished tongue sensory and motor function with increasing age might contribute to the increased prevalence of dysphagia, aspiration and pneumonia seen in the elderly (12, 13). In healthy individuals, the oral phase of swallowing is generally completed in approximately 1 second (14).
156	The process of swallowing is known as deglutition. The act of swallowing can be divided into three stages for easy understanding. 1. Oral stage: This is the only voluntary stage in the act of swallowing. It consists of: Mastication of food making it into a bolus fit to be swallowed. The main muscles involved in the act of chewing are: a. Masseter.
157	(5) neuromuscular components of swallowing. 1)Lip closure to hold the bolus in the mouth anteriorly (keeps food from spilling) 2)Tension in the labial and buccal musculature to close the anterior and lateral sulci. 3)Rotary jaw (circular) motion for mastication/grinding.
158	By Dr. Jonathan Aviv. The purpose of swallowing is to safely transport food from the mouth to the stomach. A myriad of diseases and conditions affect this basic purpose. Therefore, understanding the normal swallow is one of the keys to beginning to develop a therapeutic plan for the patient with impaired deglutition.

172	âIndian moundâ is the common name for a variety of solid structures erected by some of the indigenous peoples of the United States. Most Native American tribes did not build mounds. The majority were constructed in the Lower Southeast, Ohio River Valley, Tennessee River Valley and the Mississippi River Valley. Some types of shell mounds can be found along the entire length of the United Statesâ Atlantic Coast.

219	Physical properties can be used to identify and describe. substances. Physical properties of matter include odor, color, density, solubility, boiling point. and melting point, and its physical state at room temperature. A colorless, odorless liquid that. freezes at 0Â°C and boils at 100Â°C is probably water, for example. Every substance also has. chemical properties.
220	A photon is massless, has no electric charge, and is a stable particle. A photon has two possible polarization states. In the momentum representation of the photon, which is preferred in quantum field theory, a photon is described by its wave vector, which determines its wavelength Î» and its direction of propagation.
221	THE FOUR TYPES OF EVIDENCE. There are four traditional types of evidence: real, demonstrative, documentary, and testimonial. Some rules of evidence apply to all four types and some apply only to some or one of them. First, we will cover general rules of admissibility that apply to all evidence. Then, we will cover foundational rules that relate to specific kinds of evidence. Finally, we will cover some special topics, like the form of examination, the hearsay rule, and the lay opinion rule, that frequently cause problems in the courtroom.
222	For example, the pressure of electromagnetic radiation on an object derives from the transfer of photon momentum per unit time and unit area to that object, since pressure is force per unit area and force is the change in momentum per unit time.
223	The evolution of a gas, a color change, the formation of a precipitate, and the. evolution of heat are frequently telltale signs that a chemical reaction has occurred. You will examine some substances and describe their physical properties in this lab. You. will cause changes in some of these substances. You will decide whether the changes are. physical or chemical using test and making observations. You also will demonstrate that mass is. conserved in physical and chemical changes.
224	A photon is an elementary particle, the quantum of all forms of electromagnetic radiation including light. It is the force carrier for electromagnetic force, even when static via virtual photons.
225	) There is a sequence of steps to initiate upon arriving at an incident or crime scene to __.
226	The energy of a system that emits a photon is decreased by the energy E {\displaystyle E} of the photon as measured in the rest frame of the emitting system, which may result in a reduction in mass in the amount E / c 2 {\displaystyle {E}/{c^{2}}} .
227	Our task would be impossible but for two important facts. First, all of you have studied the law of evidence before, either in a course on evidence or in preparation for the bar exam. Accordingly, most of the rules presented will already be familiar to you.
228	In physics, a photon is usually denoted by the symbol Î³ (the Greek letter gamma). This symbol for the photon probably derives from gamma rays, which were discovered in 1900 by Paul Villard, named by Ernest Rutherford in 1903, and shown to be a form of electromagnetic radiation in 1914 by Rutherford and Edward Andrade.

239	John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes, CB (5 June 1883 â 21 April 1946) was a British economist. His ideas, called Keynesian economics, had a big impact on modern economic and political theory. His ideas also had a big impact on many governments' tax and economic policies.
240	Keynes argued that governments should solve problems in the short run rather than wait for market forces to fix things over the long run, because, as he wrote, âIn the long run, we are all dead.â This does not mean that Keynesians advocate adjusting policies every few months to keep the economy at full employment.
241	Keynesian economists are rectifying that omission by integrating the real and financial sectors of the economy.â . Sarwat Jahan is an Economist and Chris Papageorgiou is a Deputy Division Chief in the IMFâs Strategy, Policy, and Review Department.
242	Keynes argued that inadequate overall demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. An economyâs output of goods and services is the sum of four components: consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports (the difference between what a country sells to and buys from foreign countries).
243	John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes, CB, FBA (/ËkeÉªnz/ KAYNZ; 5 June 1883 â 21 April 1946), was a British economist whose ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of modern macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments.
244	British economist John Maynard Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking that overturned the then-prevailing idea that free markets would automatically provide full employmentâthat is, that everyone who wanted a job would have one as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands (see box).
245	John Maynard Keynes was born at 7 Melville Road, Cambridge, England. His father was John Neville Keynes, an economics lecturer at Cambridge University. His mother was Florence Ada Brown, a successful author and a social reformer. His younger brother, Geoffrey Keynes (1887â1982) was a surgeon and bibliophile (book lover).
246	Subsequently, the term âKeynesian economicsâ was used to refer to the concept that optimal economic performance could be achieved â and economic slumps prevented â by influencing aggregate demand through activist stabilization and economic intervention policies by the government.
247	Keynesian economics gets its name, theories, and principles from British economist John Maynard Keynes (1883â1946), who is regarded as the founder of modern macroeconomics. His most famous work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was published in 1936.
248	DEFINITION of 'Keynesian Economics'. An economic theory of total spending in the economy and its effects on output and inflation. Keynesian economics was developed by the British economist John Maynard Keynes during the 1930s in an attempt to understand the Great Depression. Keynes advocated increased government expenditures and lower taxes to stimulate demand and pull the global economy out of the Depression.

299	Using contractors and subcontractors. The difference between contractors and subcontractors. There is an important distinction between using contractors and subcontractors. Contractors. Contractors provide agreed services to a client for a set fee - and possibly duration - under a contract for services.
300	A subcontractor is a person who is hired by a general contractor (or prime contractor, or main contractor) to perform a specific task as part of the overall project and is normally paid for services provided to the project by the originating general contractor.
301	A subcontractor agreement is an agreement which specifies the terms of a relationship between a contractor and subcontractor, including the type of work the subcontractor is being hired to perform.
302	(sabkÉnËtrÓktÉ) , ((American) sabËkontraktÉr) noun. a person who undertakes work for a contractor and is therefore not directly employed by the person who wants such work done. The building contractor has employed several subcontractors to build the block of flats.
303	With this approach, each subcontractor is assigned an expected claim level or claim experience target based on its loss history, for claim categories that have a credible volume of information for actuarial projections.
304	Subcontractors are frequently hired to work on construction sites. A subcontractor agreement specifies the terms of a relationship between a contractor and subcontractor, including the type of work the subcontractor is being hired to perform. Electricians may work as subcontractors on a construction project.
305	There is an important distinction between using contractors and subcontractors. Contractors provide agreed services to a client for a set fee - and possibly duration - under a contract for services. (This is in contrast to a contract of service, eg a contract of employment, which is between an employee and employer.)
306	For the class of mathematical functions, see Subcontraction map. A subcontractor is an individual or in many cases a business that signs a contract to perform part or all of the obligations of another's contract.
307	A subcontractor has a contract with the contractor for the services provided - an employee of the contractor cannot also be a subcontractor. Subcontractors undertake work that a contractor cannot do but for which the contractor is responsible.

330	the dust bowl was caused partially by the great depression, due to the depression, farmers were trying to make maximum profit, so they cut down trees to get more land, planted too much, and let cattle graze too much, and that took out all the roots holding the soil together, causing the soil to loosen into dust and blow everywhere.

349	Water going from a gas to a liquid: Condensation. Water going from a gas to a solid: Deposition. In each phase change there will be either an absorption or release of latent heat. Latent heat absorption cools the surrounding air while latent heat release warms the surrounding air.

352	The term sublimation refers to a physical change of state and is not used to describe transformation of a solid to a gas in a chemical reaction. For example, the dissociation on heating of solid ammonium chloride into hydrogen chloride and ammonia is not sublimation but a chemical reaction.
353	Sublimation (phase transition) Sublimation is the phase transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas phase without passing through the intermediate liquid phase. Sublimation is an endothermic process that occurs at temperatures and pressures below a substance's triple point in its phase diagram.
354	Boiling Evaporation and Condensation. Evaporation is the change of phase from liquid to gas. Evaporation occurs only at the surface of the water and at every temperature. However, evaporation is directly proportional to the temperature, increasing in the temperature increasing in the rate of evaporation.
355	Sublimation is the change of state from solid to gas. Some of the solid matters change their states directly to the gas with the gained heat. For example, dry ice (frozen CO2) sublimate when heat is given. Inverse of this process is called deposition, in which gas matters lost heat and change their phase to solid.
356	CHANGE OF STATE. Evaporation, condensation, sublimation, freezing, and melting are changes of state. Evaporation is the changing of liquid water to invisible water vapor. Condensation is the reverse process. Sublimation is the changing of ice directly to water vapor, or water vapor to ice, bypassing the liquid state in each process. Snow or ice crystals result from the sublimation of water vapor directly to the solid state. We are all familiar with freezing and melting processes.
357	Introduce the process of condensation. If students do not know what the process of condensation is, you can tell them it is the opposite of evaporation. In evaporation, a liquid (like water) changes state to become a gas (water vapor). In condensation, a gas (like water vapor) changes state to become a liquid (water). Explain that as water molecules in the air cool and slow down, their attractions overcome their speed and they join together, forming liquid water. This is the process of condensation.
358	hai friend, from your points, melting, boiling and sublimation are the process done when heat taken in for transition of state of matter from solid to liquid, liquid to gas and solid to gas respectively, also evaporation comes in this section. Condensation and freezing are done when heat gone out. best regards.

369	The Koepka Genealogy and Family Tree Page. Welcome to the Koepka Family page at Surname Finder, a service of Genealogy Today. Our editors have compiled this checklist of genealogical resources, combining links to commercial databases along with user-contributed information and web sites for the Koepka surname.
370	Brooks Koepka (born May 3, 1990) is an American professional golfer. He is ranked inside the top-25 in the Official World Golf Ranking and chose a different route than other young Americans to get mainstay status on the PGA Tour, by starting his career on the European Challenge Tour and eventually the European Tour.
371	Last name: Born. This ancient name is of Anglo-Saxon origin, and is one of the earliest topographical surnames existing today. The derivation is from the Old English pre 7th Century burna, burne, spring, stream, which was originally used as a topographic name for someone who lived beside a stream.
372	Many things can go wrong when a record collection is indexed. If you're having diffculty finding Koepka ancestors in a particular database at one site, try finding it on another and compare the results.
373	In the North, however, the word burn is still used for a stream. Some instances of the modern surname, found as Bown(e), Burn(e), Burns, Born(e), Boorne, Burner and Bo(u)rner, may be locational in origin, from a place named from being beside a stream.
374	DNA testing for genealogy continues to improve. If you had some of your Koepka relatives tested several years ago, it may be worthwhile to have them retested. Likewise, as DNA testing companies have gathered more results and samples, you may be able to find more matches if you search again with your test results.
375	Last name: Born. Tweet. This ancient name is of Anglo-Saxon origin, and is one of the earliest topographical surnames existing today. The derivation is from the Old English pre 7th Century burna, burne, spring, stream, which was originally used as a topographic name for someone who lived beside a stream.
376	Nike athlete Brooks Koepka carved out a 1-under-par 34-35=69 in the final round of the Travelers Championship to post 10-under 270, down three into a two-way T9, four back of champion Russell Knox. The 26-year-old began the finale on 9-under (T6), six back of overnight leader Daniel Berger.
377	As additional sources for vital records, original documents, vintage photographs and surname-based DNA projects are discovered, this page is updated to offer the best list for researching Koepka ancestry.
378	Early years and amateur career[edit] Koepka was born in West Palm Beach, Florida but raised in Lake Worth, Florida. He attended Cardinal Newman High School. He played college golf at Florida State University where he won three events and was a three-time All-American. He qualified for the 2012 U.S. Open while still an amateur, but missed the cut.
379	A symphony is a large, multi-movement work for orchestra. It calls for instruments from all four sections (winds, strings, percussion, and brass) and explores a complete range of melody, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, and timbre. That seems like a basic definition, but even that already has a number of exceptions.
380	So we generally have either Fast-Slow-Fast-Fast or Fast-Fast-Slow-Fast. There are also different types of Key-schemes through the symphony. A good example of a classical key-scheme would be the 1st, 3rd and 4th movements are in the tonic key, but the 2nd movement and the trio of the 3rd movement are in the subdominant.
381	Some composers, including Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Carl Nielsen, continued to write in the traditional four-movement form, while other composers took different approaches: Jean Sibelius' Symphony No. 7, his last, is in one movement, whereas Alan Hovhaness's Symphony No. 9, Saint Vartanâoriginally op. 80, changed to op. 180âcomposed in 1949â50, is in twenty-four.
382	A symphony is divided into four movements; the first movement is usually fast, the second one is slow, the third is medium, and the fourth movement is fast. This pace is intended to keep the listener...
383	Lastly, the finale introduces a percussion group that is meant to be (and in the S.F. Symphony performances actually was) under the stage. It is the ticking clock on individual existence and it plays in a different tempo from the rest of the orchestra.
384	Sonata Form. Sonata form is used in many types of large-scale instrumental works of the late 18th century and the 19th century, including: Symphonies, which are technically Sonatas for Orchestra. Most Concertos are written in a modified 3-movement Sonata form, excluding the Minuet/Scherzo movement.
385	An orchestra (/ËÉËrkáµ»strÉ/ or US: /ËÉËrËkÉstrÉ/; Italian: ) is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which mixes instruments from different families, including bowed string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, each grouped in sections.
386	Indeed, after Schumann's last symphony, the Rhenish composed in 1850, for two decades the Lisztian symphonic poem appeared to have displaced the symphony as the leading form of large-scale instrumental music.
387	Believe it or not, there is a way to understand Beethoven's genius past the first eight notes. As you'll soon discover, a symphony is a form of classical music. Form is the arrangement of sections within a piece of music, and understanding how these sections work together can help the listener make sense of what the composer was trying to express.
388	1 Symphonic composition during the mature Classical period (roughly the late 18th to the early 19th century) was overwhelmingly dominated by Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven.
389	The word convict here (elegcw /elegxo) means to bring to light or expose error often with the idea of reproving or rebuking. It brings about knowledge of believing or doing something wrong, but it does not mean that the person will respond properly to that knowledge. Our usage of the English word, convict, is similar.
390	The first problem is the meaning of anothen: is it âagainâ or âfrom aboveâ? The occurrence of this same word in 3:31 with the unquestioned meaning âfrom aboveâ quickly tilts the evidence in that direction. It also has that meaning in 19:11, 23.
391	The word translated âcomfortâ by the NASU translators was parakaleo (an AAS3S). It was translated as âcomfortâ by the NASU (and NASB), KJV, NKJV, YLT (Youngâs Literal Translation), and the BBE (Bible in Basic English) and âencourageâ by the NET, NIV, NLT, ESV, NJB (New Jerusalem Bible), NRSV, and the RSV.
392	In 16:9, the problematic elegxo occurs: âin every instance the verb has to do with showing someone his sin, usually as a summons to repentanceâ (Carson, John, 537). Therefore, to convict the world is shaming it and attempting to persuade it of its guiltiness, and in this way âcalling it to repentanceâ (ibid.).
393	However, Louw & Nida include Luke 8:41 under 33.315: âto ask a person to accept offered hospitality â âto invite.ââ But parakaleo does not mean invite here, but simply to urge, implore, or even beg someone to do something.
394	The Ministry of the Holy Spirit John 16:4b-15 Introduction. This morning our scripture reading and special music have all been related to Palm Sunday in celebration of the day that Jesus made His triumphal entry into Jerusalem. That certainly was a special and exciting day.
395	The word elegxo refers to ânot only exposure but shame and convictionâ (Carson, John, 207). The Evangelist continues (3:20) by saying that those who refuse the Light actually hate the Light. This is followed by a contrast with those who âpractice the truth.â
396	The previous use of this word in the FG was at 13:10. In 15:5, being âapart fromâ the vine is contextually the opposite of abiding. The idea of being apart from the vine contains slight connotations to being the opposite of repentance.
397	Those additional things that Jesus wanted to say would come through the ministry of the Holy Spirit. Here in verse 13 the Spirit is again called the Spirit of Truth, but here Jesus adds that the Spirit will guide them into all truth.
398	If so, then 1:4b is a reference to personal holiness and not positional holiness. However, contextually, positional holiness seems to be the much preferred reading. For example, while 1:4 says that His choosing leads to our holiness, 1:5 says that Him predestining us leads to our adoption â¦ a positional concept.

409	Sherman Poppen attached two skis together in Muskegon, Mich., in 1965. His wife christened it the Snurfer and the kids loved it. He may have been inspired by a sled-like device made of plywood that first appeared in the 1920s. Poppen may have made the first snowboard; many say that he did. He certainly took a step in the evolution of snowboards.

412	He added bindings to keep their boots secure. (Randy Lee October 14, 2014) The Snurfer was believed to be fairly simple and had no bindings, but this is debatable. It is widely accepted that Jake Burton Carpenter (founder of Burton Snowboards) and/or Tom Sims (founder of Sims Snowboards) invented modern snowboarding. In 1981, a couple of Winterstick team riders went to France at the invitation of Alain Gaimard, marketing director at Les Arcs.
413	Who Invented Snowboarding? Tom Sims invented snowboarding when he built the first snowboard in 1963. Growing up in New Jersey, the young surfer and skateboarder became frustrated when ice and snow prevented him from pursuing his passion for board sports during the winter months.
414	Digital Vision/Digital Vision/Getty Images. Tom Sims invented snowboarding when he built the first snowboard in 1963. Growing up in New Jersey, the young surfer and skateboarder became frustrated when ice and snow prevented him from pursuing his passion for board sports during the winter months.
415	The next major advance came in 1982, when Sims put metal edges on his snowboard so it could be used in a wider variety of snow conditions. He went on to improve and expand the sport over the years, introducing new snowboarding styles, bindings and designs.
416	The first real ski technology for snowboards was introduced by Burton and Winterstick in 1980. Their new prototype had a P-Tex base. In 1982 the first international snowboard race was held in Suicide Six, outside of Woodstock, Vermont.
417	By 1986, although still very much a minority sport, commercial snowboards started appearing in leading French ski resorts. In 2008, selling snowboarding equipment was a $487 million industry. In 2008, average equipment ran about $540 including board, boots, and bindings.
418	Snowboards are boards that are usually the width of one's foot longways, with the ability to glide on snow. Snowboards are differentiated from monoskis by the stance of the user. In monoskiing, the user stands with feet inline with direction of travel (facing tip of monoski/downhill) (parallel to long axis of board), whereas in snowboarding, users stand with feet transverse (more or less) to the longitude of the board.
419	Hedy Lamarr: Movie star, inventor of WiFi. Hollywood is a place where folks are often recognized more for their looks than their talent - and actress Hedy Lamarr was no exception. But it's what she invented in her spare time - to help end that war - that has history turning a kinder eye, linking her to a bombshell of a whole different sort. Lee Cowan reports: She possessed the kind of beauty that was haunting - an almost smoldering sensuality, with an exotic accent to match.
420	The typical Wi-Fi setup contains one or more Access Points (APs) and one or more clients. An AP broadcasts its SSID (Service Set Identifier, Network name) via packets that are called beacons, which are broadcasted every 100ms.
421	Wi-Fi or WiFi (/ËwaÉª faÉª/) is a technology that allows electronic devices to connect to a wireless LAN (WLAN) network, mainly using the 2.4 gigahertz (12 cm) UHF and 5 gigahertz (6 cm) SHF ISM radio bands.
422	Also the firmware running on the client Wi-Fi card is of influence. Say two AP's of the same SSID are in range of the client, the firmware may decide based on signal strength (Signal-to-noise ratio) to which of the two AP's it will connect.

424	The first version of the wireless protocol's legacy is now obsolete and would be considered dreadfully slow by todayâs standards. It had a maximum data transfer rate of 2 Mbps, or Megabits per second. Most applications created today would not be able to operate efficiently at those speeds.
425	But where did it come from? In 1985, the technology called 802.11 was made available for use due to a U.S. Federal Communication Commission ruling, which released the three bands of the radio spectrum now used for nearly all wireless communication: 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5 GHz.
426	Following are a few facts about WiFi: Back in 1991 Wi-Fi was invented by NCR Corporation/AT&T (later on Lucent & Agere Systems) in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands. Initially meant for cashier systems the first wireless products were brought on the market under the name WaveLAN with speeds of 1Mbps/2Mbps. Vic Hayes who is the inventor of Wi-Fi has been named 'father of Wi-Fi' and was with his team involved in designing standards such as IEEE 802.11b, 802.11a and 802.11g.
427	When the IEEE was formed in 1990, they chose Vic Hayes, also popularly known as the Father of Wi-Fi, as its chairman. For the next ten years, Hayes helped direct the development of new wireless protocols as well as market the technology worldwide.
428	Wireless Revolution: The History of WiFi. Believe it or not, there was a time when if you wanted to get on the Internet your only option was to have a phone cable or Ethernet cable plugged directly into your computer or laptop.
429	So that's what Bezirksschornsteinfegermeister means. What was once the longest word in the German language, a tongue consisting of many ridiculously lengthy words, is no more. A regional parliament recently repealed the legislative measure, which was established in 1999, rendering the word obsolete.
430	This earns the word a Guinness World Record. It is also one of the longest monosyllabic words of the English language. 8 Euouae is six letters long, but all of the letters are vowels. It holds two Guinness World Records.
431	14 of the Longest Words in English. Yes, this article is about some of the longest English words on record. No, you will not find the very longest word in English in this article. That one word would span about fifty-seven pages. Itâs the chemical name for the titin protein found in humans. Its full name has 189,819 letters.
432	Question: What is the longest word in Spanish? Answer: The answer depends on what you mean by the longest word, but regardless of your definition the longest word isn't superextraordinarÃ­simo, the 22-letter word once listed in a famous recordbook and the word that was usually cited as the longest in the language. (It means most superextraordinary.)
433	A man has been recorded spending more than three hours to pronounce what is supposedly the longest word in the English language. 'Methionylthreonylthreonylglutaminylarginyl...isoleucine' is the chemical name of 'titin' (also known as 'connectin') - the largest known protein.
434	The 7 Longest Words In The English Language. Before we start, we thought that we should clarify a few points about our selection. Some of these words have been coined, some are scientific terms (which aren't part of everyday conversation) and some do actually appear in the dictionary.
435	The longest word in the Oxford English Dictionary is 'pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis' at 45 letters long. 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious', made famous by Mary Poppins, is 34 letters long. > 'Amazeballs', 'mummy porn', 'frenemy' make Collins online dictionary.
436	The classic longest German word is DonaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapitÃ¤n, which in English becomes four words: Danube steamship company captain.. More than most other languages, German tends to string words together to form new vocabulary. All languages, including English, do this to some extent, but German takes it to new extremes.
437	What was once the longest word in the German language, a tongue consisting of many ridiculously lengthy words, is no more. The term rindfleischetikettierungsÃ¼berwachungsaufgabenÃ¼bertragungsgesetz â that's 63 letters long for those of you keeping track at home â means the law for the delegation of monitoring beef labeling..
438	Another reason why there really isn't a single longest German word: German numbers, long or short, are written as one word. For example, to say or write the number 7,254, not really a very long number, the German is siebentausendzweihundertvierundfÃ¼nfzig, a single word of 38 letters.

479	The DNA polymerases are enzymes that create DNA molecules by assembling nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. These enzymes are essential to DNA replication and usually work in pairs to create two identical DNA strands from a single original DNA molecule.
480	DNA polymerases are responsible for adding nucleotides to the strands of new DNA being created. They are also responsible for replacing the RNA primers with DNA.
481	DNA polymerase is the enzyme that joins nucleotides together to make a new DNA strand. Other proteins separate the original DNA strands, but DNA polymerase makes new DNA.

484	The second two activities of DNA Pol I are important for replication, but DNA Polymerase III (Pol III) is the enzyme that performs the 5'-3' polymerase function.
485	DNA ligase is responsible for joining together fragments of DNA. In DNA replication, after the primers are replaced by DNA Polymerase I, DNA ligase assists in the formation ph â¦ osphodiester bonds between the fragments. This is essential for creating one continuous strand.
486	A number of proteins are associated with the replication  fork, which helps in terms of the initiation and continuation of  DNA synthesis. One protein, the DNA polymerase, creates the  new DNA by adding complementary nucleotides to the template strand.
487	The role that enzymes plays in DNA replication is that the enzyme helicase breaks hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases, and the chains separate.
488	DNA polymerase is the primary enzyme responsible for DNA  replication. Two of its major roles are: the polymerization of  dNTP's or deoxyribonucleotides, and to proofread th â¦ e new copies.

739	Answer by Thibaut Descartes. Gavrilo Princip assassinated the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarejevo. Gavrilo Princip was a member of the Black Hand, a Serbian nationalist group. Gavrilo Princip assassinated the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarejevo. Gavrilo Princip was a member of the Black Hand, a Serbian nationalist group.
740	On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were shot dead in Sarajevo, by Gavrilo Princip, one of a group of six Bosnian Serb assassins coordinated by Danilo IliÄ.
741	REUTERS/JU Muzej Sarajevo (JU Sarajevo Museum)/Handout via Reuters. One hundred years ago today in Sarajevo, a Serb nationalist shot to death at point-blank range the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and his wife Sophie.
742	Best Answer: Though Gavrilo Princip killed Franz Ferdinand, he was just a pawn in a huge assasination plan by the Black Hand, a Serbian freedom fighter group, who hoped to eliminate the Archduke due to the fact that the Archduke planned to give concessions to the South Slavs, therefore making a unified Greater Serbia more difficult to obtain.
743	Gavrilo Princip, an assassin affiliated with the Serbian Black Hand terrorist organization killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
744	On the eve of the centennial, Bosnian Serbs unveiled a statue to Gavrilo Princip, the archduke's killer, who is considered a Serbian hero and freedom-fighter.
745	Indeed, in Europe and across the pond in the United States, many learning of the archduke's death were less concerned with the drumbeats of war than the question of Austrian succession. The Washington Post, for example, published this largely fluffy piece on the royal who became the heir presumptive:
746	The Shifting Legacy Of The Man Who Shot Franz Ferdinand. The Shifting Legacy Of The Man Who Shot Franz Ferdinand. Nineteen-year-old Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip fired the shots that killed the heir to the Austro-Hungarian empire, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his wife, Sophie, during a visit to Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. Depending on whom you ask, he's either a hero or a terrorist.
747	The Archduke was killed by a group called the Black Hand by a man called Gavrilo Princip, due to the fact that the Serbians wanted freedom and independence which they didn t get, which made the Serbians want revenge, forming the terrorist group, The Black Hand and successfully killing Franz Ferdinand and his 6 month pregnant wife, Sophie.
748	This plan included 2 other conspirators,Nedjelko Cabrinovic, and Trifko Grabez, though they obviously all failed in their assasination attempts. The original plan was that these 3 people would kill the Archduke while he was driving though the streets of Sarajevo on his way to visit the city hall. Nedjelko, who made the first attempt, threw a grenade at the Archduke's car, but it instead missed, rolled underneath another car in the motorcade, and exploded.

If your acetaminophen drug level test is high, it means you may be at greater risk for liver damage and need treatment. Your health care provider may repeat this test every 4 to 6 hours until you are out of danger.
751	A blood level of acetaminophen higher than 200 mcg/mL 4 hours after ingestion means there is risk for liver damage. If the test shows a level of 50 mcg/mL or greater 12 hours after you've taken the drug, there is still risk for liver damage. Overdose levels for children are based on age and weight.
752	The acetaminophen drug level is a blood test used to screen for the presence of the common pain reliever acetaminophen. (Tylenol and paracetamol are among several other names for the same medicine.). This over-the-counter (OTC) medicine is used to treat pain and reduce fever.
753	For patients using the oral liquid with dropper: 1  Shake the bottle well before each use. 2  Measure the dose with the provided dropper. 3  Remove the cap, insert the dropper and withdraw the dose prescribed by your doctor. 4  Slowly give the medicine into your child's mouth (towards the inner cheek). 5  Replace the cap back tightly.
754	15 mg to 60 mg. 360 mg. Acetaminophen. 300 mg to 1000 mg. 4000 mg. Doses may be repeated up to every 4 hours. The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours, based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.
755	If treatment is received within 8 hours of the overdose, however, there is a very good chance of recovery. For children who have taken acetaminophen in liquid form, a treatment decision may be made as soon as 2 hours after ingestion since the drug is absorbed more rapidly in this form. ^ Back to top.
756	The test for acetaminophen is used to measure the level of drug in the blood in order to establish a diagnosis of overdosage, to assess the risk of liver damage, and to help decide on the need for treatment. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important for a positive outcome.
757	1 Shake the bottle well before each use. 2  Measure the dose with the provided dropper. 3  Do not use any other syringe, dropper, spoon, or dosing device when giving this medicine to your child. 4  Remove the cap, insert the dropper and withdraw the dose prescribed by your doctor.
758	It is not safe to use more than 4 grams (4,000 milligrams) of acetaminophen in one day (24 hours), as this may increase the risk for serious liver problems. For TylenolÂ® Extra Strength, the maximum dose is 3,000 milligrams per 24 hours. You may take this medicine with or without food.

801	Select a Time Period: The Roman Empire began to slowly decline in the 3rd century AD, one of the main causes of Rome's early decline was a series of plagues, most notably the Plague of Cyprian, which decimated the population of the Empire, making it harder for Roman Emperors to levy armies and raise taxes.
802	Even if the Romans of Rome still held the title to the Empire and affected superiority over the barbarians managing their domain, Roman possession of the lands around the Mediterranean Sea was, for the most part, only on paper.
803	The Roman Empire was among the most powerful economic, cultural, political and military forces in the world of its time. It was one of the largest empires in world history. At its height under Trajan, it covered 5 million square kilometres, a territory composed of 48 nations in the 21st century.
804	I. Introduction: Rome Before the Fall [click here for a brief overview of Roman history] After nearly half a millennium of rule, the Romans finally lost their grip on Europe in the fifth century (the 400's CE).
805	The imperial successor to the republic lasted approximately 1,500 years. The first two centuries of the empire's existence were a period of unprecedented political stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana, or Roman Peace. Following Octavian's victory, the size of the empire was dramatically increased.
806	Despite the travails of their Western counterparts, the Eastern emperorsâby then, there were two Roman emperors, one in Rome and one in Constantinopleâcontinued to demand that the entire Empire pay taxes into a common treasury.
807	The city of Rome was the largest city in the world c. 100 BC â c. 400 AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time).

819	There have been many innovations in the shapes of tea bags over the years. The earliest tea bags were sack-like in shape. Later, tea bags became flat and rectangular. In the 1950s, Lipton invented the multi-dimensional Flo-Thru tea bag, which gave leaves more room to open.
820	Oolong, a Chinese name for âblack dragon,â is a light, floral tea that, like green tea, is also packed with catechins, which help to promote weight loss by boosting your bodyâs ability to metabolise lipids (fat).
821	One part of the documentary covered Lipton tea and how it's made from many blends of tea. Up to 40 different kinds of black tea. So your lipton tea is basically a blend to get that lipton taste, so you never know where it's from or what kind of black tea it is. A tea taster would sip different teas and give them a number, then they would blend them according to these numbers to get that familiar taste.
822	I've been drinking Lipton Diet Green Tea Citrus for several years. I purchased a 12 pack of bottles at Walmart on Oct 7th of this year. The first bottle I only drank half of because it hardly had any taste and no sweetness at all. I also noticed that it had some brown sediment in the bottom of the bottle.
823	Hey, I heard that lipton tea is the best, but I want to know which flavor is the best,. Thanks. If you're limited to Lipton, I would say go for the pyramid style bags if you can find them. The bedtime story blend is actually pretty decent. If you're limited to tea bags, my advice would be to go for a loose leaf tea and just purchase a reusable tea bag to place the loose leaf tea in.
824	It will even be called a Lipton like people may say a NescafÃ© (instead of a cup of coffee). Now this is my experience from living in the Middle East (Arabian Gulf) where the majority population is migrant South Asian. I'm sure there is variety in tea habits on the actual subcontinent.
825	Tea is not as fresh as it used to be before new packaging. The tea labels disintegrate when I drop the bags in hot water. After 30 years of being a Lipton tea lover, I am ready to hunt a better tea. I always have bought the 100 single bag count regular brew.
826	After 50 years of drinking Lipton tea every day (in recent years from tea bags in the 100 box), I am abandoning this product. Life is too short to drink bad tea, and Lipton is no longer of good quality on a consistent basis. Frequently now it is just not even drinkable.

849	T/F: Air is the medium that sound waves travel through. T/F: Sound waves are a disturbance that moves through the air. T/F: Air molecules are carried along with sound waves. T/F: The speed of a wave depends on the medium through which it travels.
850	Shock Waves and Sonic Booms. The Doppler effect is observed whenever the speed of the source is moving slower than the speed of the waves. But if the source actually moves at the same speed as or faster than the wave itself can move, a different phenomenon is observed.
851	Asked by: Lockyear. Sonic boom is a common name for the loud noise that is created by the 'shock wave' produced by the air-plane that is traveling at speeds greater than that of sound ( speed of sound is approximately 332 m/s or 1195 km/hr or 717 miles/hour). These speeds are called supersonic speeds, hence this phenomena is sometimes called the supersonic boom.
852	I myself think that it is D, cause a sonic boom is caused when you break the sound barrier (speed of sound) so you need to be above the speed of sound, hope it helps 1  :) Comments (5) 2  Report.
853	Which below describes the conditions needed for a shock wave to form. An object moves at the speed of sound. The wave speed equals the objectâs speed. The wave speed equals the objectâs speed. An object moves faster than the speed of sound.
854	circle the letter that describes how increasing the speed of the wave source above the wave speed affects the shape of the bow wave that is formed. a. the bow wave is unchanged. b. the bow wave has a narrower v shape.
855	This phenomenon is known as a shock wave. Shock waves are also produced if the aircraft moves faster than the speed of sound. If a moving source of sound moves faster than sound, the source will always be ahead of the waves that it produces.
856	The Doppler effect can be observed to occur with all types of waves - most notably water waves, sound waves, and light waves. The application of this phenomenon to water waves was discussed in detail in Unit 10 of The Physics Classroom Tutorial.
857	Which best describes when a sonic boom occurs? A. when a object travels at or above the speed of sound. B. when an object travels at the speed of sound. C.When an object travels below the speed of sound. D. When an object travels above the speed of sound.
858	suppose a friend far away taps a metal fence. a. the sound is softer and travels slower through the metal than through air. b.the sound is louder and travels slower through the metal than through air. c. the sound is softer and travels faster through the metal than through air. d. the sound is louder and travels faster through the metal than through air.

1036	I also got a Buff Orpington hen from someone else, I was told she was hatched in Feb/Mar 2010. The 2 ex battery hens started laying soon after I got them and still are laying but my Buff Orpington still hav'nt started laying.
1037	Itâs understandable that a first-time chicken-keeper may be anxious to know when they can reasonably expect to see the first egg in the nest box from their new flock. Here are general guidelines for what to watch for and how to help prepare a chicken to lay her first egg.
1038	Different breeds have different amounts or shades of the pigment which accounts for Buff Orpingtons laying pale brown eggs, while Marans lay dark chocolate brown eggs. While the egg color is determined by breed and genetics within the breed, there are a few things you can do to ensure the darkest egg color.
1039	At maturity they weigh around 6 pounds and should start laying large brown eggs at approximately 24 weeks. These pullets are not debeaked for better foraging and they free range on our farm. We also feed them healthy rations of all natural chicken feeds. All have been fully vaccinated.
1040	See all reviews. Our first chickenOrdered a started Buff Orpington pullet. She arrived in great condition and has been living in her new home for 2 weeks. She laid an egg on the first day she arrived. She is a nice bird, docile and good with the children who are responsible for her care.
1041	linda07965 Junior Member. My 11/12 month old buff orpington has finely layed her first egg, she must of known I posted a message on here last week lol. I went to the nest box 2 days ago and there was a cream/slight pinky small egg in there which is a complete different colour egg to what my 2 ex-battery hens lay.
1042	One bantam was six months, the other was seven months, and the large fowl were both eight months old before laying. My 11/12 month old buff orpington has finely layed her first egg, she must of known I posted a message on here last week lol. I went to the nest box 2 days ago and there was a cream/slight pinky small egg in there which is a complete different colour egg to what my 2 ex-battery hens lay.
1043	battery hens are bred to lay, and thats what they do non stop. orpingtons are dual purpose birds, so wont lay as many eggs and the larger breeds tend to start a bit later. 12 months is a bit late but weve had really bad , cold weather so that could delay her.
1044	No matter what the breed or what color the egg ultimately ends up being, all eggshells are white when they start their journey down the oviduct. This journey takes about 26 hours, the shell taking roughly 20 hours to be completed. In the last 4-6 hours of the laying process brown eggs 'turn' brown. A hen spending too much time in the sunlight can actually have a bleaching effect on the color egg that a hen lays, as can not having access to cool water.
1045	They are so named because they can lay a variety of shades of green (mint, pale, bright, olive), pinkish or cream eggs. A particular chicken will only lay one color egg her entire life, but each EE could lay a different color egg for you. Truly a mystery until she lays her first egg.
1046	Option Pending-known as OP status means the contract is in an option period, this typically stays 7-14 days and also buyer needs to pay the option fee as well. In this case, the seller has no right to terminate the contract during this period, just only the buyer. about 3 years ago. 0 1.
1047	It is the responsibility of the listing agent to bring offers made on the home to the bank or mortgage company for their approval or rejection. All short sales are pending the mortgage companies approval. The listing agent is just announcing in the listing that itâs a short sale listing. If you make an offer for the property it may take weeks before you get confirmation that your offer has been accepted and your deposit will be tied up until you have confirmation.
1048	What does Pending Listing for Sale mean. We have an earnest money contract signed by both parties and credit pre-approved but today the language on Har changed from Pending to Pending listing for sale. I know the house was appraised 2 days ago but now concerned.
1049	Listings with the status âpending releaseâ (status 2) or âpending continue to showâ (status 3) that state âno more offersâ or âno more showingsâ are incorrectly classified. If the property is not available to show or not accepting offers, the status should be âpending no showâ (status 4). A list of the different statuses and their uses can be found on the MLSListings Portal and below. Active â Valid listing contract exists and no offer has been accepted. Pending with release, continue to show (PR) or (Pend w/Rls) â Accepted offer on the property, and a release, âescapeâ or âkick-outâ clause exists in a purchase contract that allows one party to withdraw under certain circumstances.
1050	âActive/Pending Short-Saleâ would mean the real estate agent has an offer that is waiting for approval from the bank AND the agent is still showing the house, hoping for better offers. All short-sale offers must be approved by the bank.
1051	On March 26, 2015, HAR implemented the following update: 3 days after the Option End Date passes, the system automatically changes the listing from the Option Pending status to the Pending status.
1052	Best Answer: It means a buyer made the seller an offer to purchase their house. The sellers accepted the buyer's offer. It is now in the 'Pending' status awaiting financing. It is off the market, pending mortgage approval. If the buyers can not qualify for a mortgage, the house will be back on the market usually in 30-60 days. Usually it is sold and you don't have a chance.
1053	OP-Option Pending means that the buyer has paid a fee for the unrestricted right to terminate the contract during the 'option period'. The buyer and seller agree on the amount of the fee and the length of time for the option period.
1054	Active/Pending = Usually that means the seller would like to get more offers. Savvy agents want back-up offers in place. If you made an offer to purchase a property and the seller agreed to the price, but already has a buyer in contract, you would be the 1st position back-up buyer.
1055	If the seller and agent will not show or accept offers on a property for a period of time the status of the listing should be changed to âtemporarily withdrawnâ (status 8). This will indicate to the cooperating brokers and their client(s) that the seller is not actively soliciting offers and showings for the property.

1130	(Note that some things in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location.
1131	The consequences of this development for the world at large are staggering: 1  A typical family of four is expected to have 50 connected devices in 2022, double the number of 2017. 2  By the same year, 30 billion such devices are to expected to exist. 3  As a consequence, the Internet of Things will become a trillion industry.

1156	Right now, he has 6oz. of formula every 3 hours. A: Whatever feeding schedule gets the most food into your baby with the least amount of hassles is the right one for you and your baby. Remember, feeding your baby is a social interaction, not just delivery of food.
1157	Lastly, teeth appear around six months. So, if your baby is not happy about solids at four months, wait a month or two and try again. All his nutritional needs can be met by the infant formula (figure approximately two ounces of formula per pound of baby's weight).
1158	1- Make a bottle of formula (6 ounces). Take one ounce from bottle and add to one tablespoon of single grain rice cereal in a bowl. Use a soft ended spoon to mix and feed (let baby taste it at first).Make sure he is sitting up with you or in a chair. 2- Feed this cereal mix 1x per day at evening not close to bed. Do this for five days.
1159	Watch for any reactions. 4- After that, feed 2 tablespoons of single grain oatmeal + 1 1/2 ounces of formula once a day.

While there are many non-dairy foods that are rich in calcium, dairy is such an excellent source of calcium that it qualifies as a food group. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, you need about three servings of dairy every day. The downside of dairy is that it can be high in saturated fat.
1218	1 To increase your magnesium, eat whole grains, vegetables such as summer squash, green beans, broccoli, cucumbers, and spinach, and nuts and seeds.  Adult women under 30 need 310 milligrams a day, while women over 30 need 320 milligrams. Men need 400 milligrams before 30 and 420 milligrams after 30.
1219	1 Many dairy products, such as butter, cheese, and milk have vitamin D. Fortified cereals and fish are also good sources of this vitamin.  For adults under 70 years of age, 600 international units of vitamin D per day is sufficient. Adults over 70 should consume 800 international units.
1220	More isn't always better: Too much calcium has risks. Dietary calcium is generally safe, but more isn't necessarily better, and excessive calcium doesn't provide extra bone protection. If you take calcium supplements and eat calcium-fortified foods, you may be getting more calcium than you realize.
1221	Make sure you are getting enough magnesium in your daily diet to help absorb the calcium supplements you're taking. To increase your magnesium, eat whole grains, vegetables such as summer squash, green beans, broccoli, cucumbers, and spinach, and nuts and seeds.
1222	Calcium supplements aren't for everyone. For instance, if you have a health condition that causes excess calcium in your bloodstream (hypercalcemia), you should avoid calcium supplements. It's not definitive, but there may be a link between calcium supplements and heart disease.
1223	To calculate the amount of calcium in your diet, you need to keep track of your food using a food journal. Basically, you write down everything you eat in a day, including the serving size. Then you can calculate the amount of calcium in the foods you ate. For instance, a cup of yogurt has 415 milligrams of calcium.
1224	You can use more yogurt (and more calcium) to thicken your smoothie bowl, too. Smoothie bowls are often made with fresh berries -- not only for good nutrition but also for the gorgeous colors. Make your smoothie bowl a work or art by topping it with nuts, seeds, granola and dried or fresh fruit.
1225	Even if you eat a healthy, balanced diet, you may find it difficult to get enough calcium if you: 1  Follow a vegan diet. 2  Have lactose intolerance and limit dairy products.  Consume large amounts of protein or sodium, which can cause your body to excrete more calcium.
1226	Shredding important documents like your MSN, Explanation of Benefits (EOB), other statements, and bills will ensure that thieves cannot get their hands on this sensitive information. â¢ Reviewing your MSN is one of the best ways that you can help detect potential errors and fraud.
1227	It is important to immediately open and read your MSN to make sure that you have received all of the services listed. â¢ Use the Personal Health Care Journal, which you can obtain from your local SMP, to keep a record of medical visits, tests, receipts for services, and equipment you have received.
1228	Youâll get your MSN every 3 months if you get any services or medical supplies during that 3-month period. If you donât get any services or medical supplies during that 3-month period you wonât get an MSN for that particular 3-month period.
1229	â¢ Review your MSN and compare it to your receipts, records and Personal Health Care Journal. If you notice any mistakes, or have questions, report them immediately! Call your provider or health plan with your questions. If you still have unanswered questions, call your local SMP.
1230	Explaining the Medicare Summary Notice. When you are enrolled in Medicare, and you receive health services, the health care provider directly bills Medicare. The Medicare program pays your health care provider for her services. You then receive a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN), describing the services and cost of service. The MSN is a not a bill to you, but you should spend some time reviewing the information, nonetheless.
1231	â¢ Protecting your personal information is the first line of defense against fraud. Although you should save your Medicare Summary Notices and related statements, make sure to shred them when they are no longer useful.
1232	1 If you paid a bill before you got your notice, compare your MSN with the bill to make sure you paid the right amount for your services. 2  If an item or service is denied, call your doctorâs or other health care provider's office to make sure they submitted the correct information. 3  If not, the office may resubmit.
1233	The Medicare Summary Notice contains a summary of your benefits for Medicare, including Part A, Part B and Part C. In mid-2013, the federal government redesigned the Medicare Summary Notice. Based on the results of a study of Medicare recipients, several changes were made that make the MSN easier to read and understand.
1234	It's not a bill. Itâs a notice that people with Original Medicare get in the mail every 3 months for their Medicare Part A and Part B-covered services.
1235	Medicare Summary Notice. A notice sent to a patient by Medicare showing all the services or supplies that providers and suppliers billed to Medicare during the prior 3-month period, what Medicare paid, and what the patient owes the provider.

1279	The plan has the flexibility to increase some deployments to seven months compared with the normal six-month assignments, the Navy said this week.

1298	Speedy Gonzales, the beloved Looney Tunes mouse who can outrun the fastest of cats and whose Arriba! Arriba! Andale! Andale! cry was a Saturday morning staple for kids growing up in the 1960s, is being eyed as an animated feature at Warner Bros. with Mexicoâs own beloved filmmaker/actor Eugenio Derbez voicing the mouse. âIn Mexico we grew up watching Speedy Gonzales,â Derbez told Deadline. âHe was like a superhero to us, or maybe more like a revolutionario like Simon Bolivar or Pancho Villa.

1314	After eating, peristalsis in the ileum forces chyme into the cecum. When the cecum is distended with chyme, contractions of the ileocecal sphincter strengthen. Once chyme enters the cecum, colon movements begin. Mechanical digestion in the large intestine includes a combination of three types of movements.
1315	The ileum is the last section of the small intestine. Like the jejunum, it is also around 10 feet long and its pH lies between 7 and 8. The bacterial density here is also 10 4 -10 7 CFU/mL and has a microbe community similar to that of the colon.
1316	Second, as the discussion of physical planning indicated, it is not to be assumed that the particular patterns of factory size, task composition and subdivison. grouping of tasks into jobs, and work group arrangements involved in production are a direct consequence of the requirements of physical technology.
1317	Cloud computing has been a hugely disruptive technology in the business world, displacing many resources that would conventionally have been located in-house or provided as a traditionally hosted service.
1318	AOL: Three Decades of Turmoil. Introduction. AOL has gone from fame and glory to hype to trying everything possible simply to survive. Started in 1983 as âQuantum Computerâ (Agamawi, 2012), later renamed America Online, the company went public on the NASDAQ in 1992 and proceeded to grow 50,000% in just two yearâs time.
1319	In January 2001 AOL merged with what was widely considered a conservative media company called Time Warner, itself having been built largely through mergers and acquisitions. At the time of the merger, Time Warner was valued at $90 billion, compared to AOLâs $175 billion.
1320	The development of Western technology . One of the most fascinating problems of technological change is the rise and continuing development of Western âindustrialâ technology, and it has attracted a corresponding amount of attention.
1321	Finally, a firm×³s culture has also been identified as a critical precondition for the emergence of disruptive innovation. Firm culture refers to a core set of attitudes and practices that are shared by the members of the firm (Detert et al., 2000; Martin, 2002 ; Schultz and Hatch, 1996).
1322	Major changes in human life have been associated with major technological changes, such as the âfood-producing revolution,â the âurban revolution,â and the âindustrial revolutionâ and its modern continuations; even the evolution of biologically modern man has been influenced by innovations in tool using.
1323	Much less attention has been paid to the role of innovation processes, including their goals and design, in promoting disruptive innovation. In this paper we aim to begin to fill this gap by better understanding how new innovation processes can act as antecedents for disruptive innovation.

1325	A disruptive technology is one that displaces an established technology and shakes up the industry or a ground-breaking product that creates a completely new industry. Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen coined the term disruptive technology. In his 1997 best-selling book, The Innovator's Dilemma, Christensen separates new technology into two categories: sustaining and disruptive.
1326	There are two places where the bicep muscle connects: the shoulder and the elbow. In your shoulder, tendons connect your bicep into the shoulder joint. In your elbow, tendons keep the muscle attached to your lower arm. We most often see bicep injuries at the connection point with your shoulder. Strains or tears can develop in the ligaments.
1327	Rotator cuff. A combination of muscles and tendons keeps your arm centered in your shoulder socket. These tissues are called the rotator cuff. They cover the head of your upper arm bone and attach it to your shoulder blade. Biceps tendons. The biceps muscle is in the front of your upper arm.
1328	10 Possible Causes of Arm Pain. Featured, Your Health. Sources of arm pain are numerous, affecting the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and bones of the arm, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, and fingers. If youâre experiencing a strange pain, tenderness, or numbness in your arm, and you donât know why, consider the following 10 common causes of arm painâ¦.
1329	Left shoulder pain can be extremely concerning, especially when the cause is unknown. The pain may occur when you breathe deeply, making it very difficult to function throughout the day. Left shoulder pain may be the result of normal activities of daily living to serious health conditions.
1330	Years of shoulder wear and tear can cause the biceps tendon to become inflamed. Examination of the tissues in these cases commonly shows signs of degeneration. Degeneration in a tendon causes a loss of the normal arrangement of the collagen fibers that join together to form the tendon.
1331	An injury to the shoulder or surrounding region can cause pain and discomfort. Injury related left shoulder pain is usually quite obvious to a person, particularly if it manifests itself right after the accident that caused the injury. In some cases the pain may not develop immediately after an injury.
1332	Persistent pain and weakness may be a sign of a serious strain of the biceps that may also involve tearing of the attachment of the tendon inside the shoulder joint. Such serious injury may require surgery. If persistent pain and weakness is experienced the injury should be re-evaluated by a surgeon.
1333	Rotator cuff/bicep tendinosis is diagnosed by eliciting pain or weakness with stress testing of the rotator cuff muscles. There are two common tests used for diagnosis of impingement: The Neerâs Test and the Hawkinsâ Test. The Neer's test elicits pain with passive abduction of the shoulder to 180 degrees.
1334	Biceps Tendinitis. Biceps tendinitis is an inflammation or irritation of the upper biceps tendon. Also called the long head of the biceps tendon, this strong, cord-like structure connects the biceps muscle to the bones in the shoulder. Pain in the front of the shoulder and weakness are common symptoms of biceps tendinitis.
1335	Article Sections. Patients with acute brachial plexus neuritis are often misdiagnosed as having cervical radiculopathy. Acute brachial plexus neuritis is an uncommon disorder characterized by severe shoulder and upper arm pain followed by marked upper arm weakness. The temporal profile of pain preceding weakness is important in establishing a prompt diagnosis and differentiating acute brachial plexus neuritis from cervical radiculopathy.

1346	You will probably be surprised to find that your per-mile costs to fuel cars are cheaper with electric cars than with gas cars. Calculating your per-mile cost for gas cars is pretty simple, as long as you know your average cost for a gallon of gasoline, your typical fuel economy and the number of miles you drive. For example, if your car gets 25 mpg and gas is $4 per gallon, it will cost you 16 cents per mile in gasoline.
1347	About Gas Mileage Savings Calculator: Car Cost vs. Fuel Savings. You would like to save money on gas so you're considering trading in your gas guzzler for a more fuel efficient car. This calculator shows how long will it take before you pay off the balance of a vehicle purchase and really begin saving money. Based on the EPA's MPG data and assuming 45% highway driving and 55% city driving.
1348	The new label assigns each vehicle a rating from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) for fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions (i.e., how much carbon dioxide the vehicleâs tailpipe emits each mile), as shown below. Consumers may note that higher fuel economy is associated with a better GHG emissions profile.
1349	Itâs that simple. We take the average distance that a gasoline-powered vehicle can drive on a gallon of gas (28.2 miles for comparable 2012 model year cars), and then calculate how much it would cost to drive the average EV that same distance.
1350	Fuel consumption rate. Kilowatt-hours is an energy unit for electricity. This value tells you how many kilowatt-hours the vehicle would use to travel 100 miles. Like gallons per 100 miles, this kilowatt-hours per 100 miles value relates directly to the amount of electricity used, and thus to cost.
1351	The fuel savings, in gallons, for a vehicle that gets 10 MPG versus a vehicle that gets 15 MPG is about 33 gallons (assuming 1,000 miles). On the other hand, the fuel savings in gallons - for the same five MPG fuel economy jump - for a 30 MPG versus a 35 MPG vehicle is only about five gallons.
1352	*Gas driving costs are based on current prices of $2.31/gallon and assume a 25m/gallon gas mileage. Average 2013 gas prices were $3.58/gallon (Energy Information Administration). EV driving costs are based on 35 kwh/100 miles and standard residential rates.
1353	The price of gasoline is posted at every corner gas station, but what about the cost of driving on electricity? The Department of Energyâs eGallon provides a quick and simple answer to this question and allows electric vehicle (EV) drivers to see how much they can save on fuel by using electricity instead of gasoline.
1354	Calculate the savings from trading in your gas guzzler. You would like to save money on gas so you're considering trading in your gas guzzler for a more fuel efficient car. This calculator shows how long will it take before you pay off the balance of a vehicle purchase and really begin saving money.
1355	Calculating your electricity cost is a bit more complicated. First, visit the automaker's website for the electric car to get the specifics on the projected charging times for the type of charging system you intend to use. Then, you'll need to use your electric company's kilowatt-hour rates.
1356	Morphine, sold under many trade names, is a pain medication of the opiate type. It acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to decrease the feeling of pain. It can be used for both acute pain and chronic pain. Morphine is also frequently used for pain from myocardial infarction and during labour.It can be administered orally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intravenously, into the space around the spinal cord, or rectally.orphine is a precursor in the manufacture in a large number of opioids such as dihydromorphine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and oxycodone as well as codeine, which itself has a large family of semi-synthetic derivatives.
1357	Morphine is part of a class of drugs called opiate (narcotic) analgesics, or opioid agonists, which block the transmission of pain signals to the brain by binding to nervous system proteins called opioid receptors.Morphine is also sometimes prescribed off label to treat pain in hospitalized children.: Morphine is a medication that is used for pain management and is in the class of medications called opioid narcotics. Opioids act by attaching to specific proteins called opioid receptors, which are found in the brain, spinal cord, and gastrointestinal tract.

1387	The term large-ion lithophile element (or LILE) is frequently used, but poorly defined in the geochemical literature. Some authors use LILE as a synonym for incompatible (or hygromagmatophile) trace elements (e.g.), whereas others use LILE to refer to a specific subset of incompatible trace elements characterized by small charge to ionic radius ratio (or low field strength elements; ). relative to more compatible trace elements. The LILE are strongly enriched in the upper continental crust (. ), but occur in lower concentrations in the deep continental crust due to its overall more mafic character and selective loss of some LILE during high-grade metamorphism (see Metamorphism).

1433	Poetic Form: Sonnet. read poems by this poet. William Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564, in Stratford-on-Avon. The son of John Shakespeare and Mary Arden, he was probably educated at the King Edward IV Grammar School in Stratford, where he learned Latin and a little Greek and read the Roman dramatists. At eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman seven or eight years his senior. Together they raised two daughters: Susanna, who was born in 1583, and Judith (whose twin brother died in boyhood), born in 1585. Little is known about Shakespeare's activities between 1585 and 1592.
1434	He died one month later, on April 23, 1616. To the world, he left a lasting legacy in the form of 38 plays, 154 sonnets, and two narrative poems. When William Shakespeare died in his birthplace of Stratford-upon-Avon, he was recognized as one of the greatest English playwrights of his era.
1435	Therefore, unlike his fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe, he did not attend university. Rather, in 1582 at age 18, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior and three months pregnant. Their first child, Susanna, was born in 1583, and twins, Hamnet and Judith, came in 1585.
1436	Thousands of people every year continue to follow this tradition and visit Shakespeareâs Birthplace â and the house remains one of Stratford-upon-Avonâs busiest attractions.
1437	He drew up his will in January of 1616, which included his famous bequest to his wife of his second best bed.. He died on April 23, 1616, and was buried two days later at Stratford Church.
1438	The Life of William Shakespeare (1564â1616). Within the class system of Elizabethan England, William Shakespeare did not seem destined for greatness. He was not born into a family of nobility or significant wealth.
1439	Yet in spite of these limitations, Shakespeare is now the most performed and read playwright in the world. Born to John Shakespeare, a glovemaker and tradesman, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent farmer, William Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon.
1440	The money was raised successfully and the house was in the safe hands of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust by 1847. Today, the house has been converted into a museum and is open to the public all year round.
1441	Shakespeare's Birth. The baptismal register of the Holy Trinity parish church, in Stratford, shows the following entry for April 26, 1564: Gulielmus filius Johannes Shakespeare.
1442	Shakespeare was born in 1564 into a prosperous family in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK. Although there is no record of his birth, it is presumed that Shakespeare was born on 23 April because he was entered into the baptism register of Holy Trinity Church shortly after.

1453	It sucks in smoke   Smoke is made up of mostly solid substances dispersed in a gas. The electrostatic smoke precipitator generates static electricity, this then gives the s â¦ olid particles passing through them a negative charge.
1454	Air is drawn into the unit to capture particles. The airborne particles pass through an electrostatic field and receive an ionized charge. The charged particles move into a collector section where each alternate plate is charged with the same polarity as the particles. This drives the particles to the second set of plates of an opposite charge to attract and collect the particles. The cleaned air is then returned to the plant or building.
1455	We use DC voltages in an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) because it is necessary to induce a charge on the particulates, and then attract them to a plate by the use of an opp â¦ osite charge. An AC source would be changing constantly.
1456	Electrostatic Precipitator Facts. 1  Electrostatic Precipitators use up to 50% less energy than equivalently sized media air cleaners. 2  Unlike media air cleaners and cartridge collectors that can lose up to 50% of its airflow with a dirty filter, electrostatic precipitators see an airflow drop of less than 5% when dirty.
1457	Answer by Ftrip. Confidence votes 14. With a high voltage applied to the discharge electrodes a strong electrical field is created between the electrodes and the flue gas is ionised, plus-ions migrate to the negative electrode and minus-ions migrate to the ground electrode.
1458	Unlike media air cleaners that use replaceable filters that plug up when dirty, electrostatic precipitators contain permanent cells that can be washed, either manually or with an included automatic wash system. These permanent cells do not require added static pressure when they get dirty to pull air through them.
1459	Electrostatic Precipitators for Power Plants. Many countries around the world, including our own, depend on coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity. A natural result from the burning of fossil fuels, particularly coal, is the emission of flyash. Ash is mineral matter present in the fuel.
1460	Electrostatic precipitators are not only used in utility applications but also other industries (for other exhaust gas particles) such as cement (dust), pulp & paper (salt cake & lime dust), petrochemicals (sulfuric acid mist), and steel (dust & fumes).
1461	These fabric filters are inherently large structures resulting in a large pressure drop, which reduces the plant efficiency. Electrostatic precipitators have collection efficiency of 99%, but do not work well for flyash with a high electrical resistivity (as commonly results from combustion of low-sulfur coal). In addition, the designer must avoid allowing unburned gas to enter the electrostatic precipitator since the gas could be ignited.
1462	Electrostatic spray painting works because when the paint particles are released from the spray gun they have a negative charge and since your item is positively charged the n â¦ egative particles are attracted to it.

1503	Wine is 85 to 90 percent water, so it freezes at about 20 F (-6.7 C) -- the water freezes first at 32 F (zero C) and then the alcohol after that [source: Wine Spectator ]. It'll be slushy for a while before it becomes solid. A word to the wise: Don't freeze wine in the bottle.
1504	1 The liquid left behind is richer in alcohol, and as a consequence, further freezing would take place at progressively lower temperatures. 2  The frozen material, while always poorer in alcohol than the (increasingly rich) liquid, becomes progressively richer in alcohol.
1505	1 Freezing in this scenario begins at a temperature significantly below 0 Â°C. 2  The first material to freeze is not the water, but a dilute solution of alcohol in water. 3  The liquid left behind is richer in alcohol, and as a consequence, further freezing would take place at progressively lower temperatures.
1506	Mendeleev, the chemist who devised the periodic table, standardized the amount of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) in vodka when he was the Director of the Russian Bureau of Standards. Russian vodka is 40% ethanol and 60% water by volume (80 proof). Vodka from other countries may range from 35% to 50% ethanol by volume.
1507	The best-known freeze-distilled beverages are applejack and ice beer. Ice wine is the result of a similar process, but in this case, the freezing happens before the fermentation, and thus it is sugar, not alcohol, that gets concentrated. For an in depth discussion of the physics and chemistry, see eutectic point.
1508	A bottle of 190-proof Everclear has a freezing point of -173.2 F (-114 C), so it would come out well-chilled but still 100 percent liquid after a day in the freezer [source: Sauce ]. Eighty-proof vodka freezes at -16.5 F (-27 C), so it'd also survive unfrozen [source: Alcoholic Science ].
1509	The freezing point depends on the spirit's proof, or alcoholic concentration, which is is double its alcohol percentage. Vodka is usually about 80 proof, or 40 percent alcohol. Wine is usually around 28 proof, and grain alcohol is 190 proof -- pretty darn close to pure alcohol [source: Real Simple ].
1510	This phenomenon is known as freezing point depression. It is possible to freeze vodka, but not in a typical home freezer. The freezing point of 80 proof vodka is -26.95Â° C or -16.51Â° F, while the temperature of most home freezers is around -17Â° C. By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D.
1511	1 The first material to freeze is not the water, but a dilute solution of alcohol in water. 2  The liquid left behind is richer in alcohol, and as a consequence, further freezing would take place at progressively lower temperatures.
1512	Why doesn't vodka freeze when you put it in the freezer? The answer to the question has to do with the chemical composition of vodka and a phenomenon known as freezing point depression.

1534	10 Most Outrageous Things Benjamin Franklin Ever Did. Some call him âThe Newton of Electricity,â and others call him âThe First American.â Whatever the nickname, we can all agree Benjamin Franklin was one of a kind. After all, he invented his own alphabet, was a chess master, and thereâs even a psychological effect bearing his name.
1535	Hereâs what is known about Franklinâs formal education: 1  Franklinâs father sent Benjamin to the Boston Latin School at age eight. This public school designed to provide education in the humanities to all boys regardless of their social class.
1536	Surprisingly, although Benjamin Franklin was an accomplished inventor, scientist, writer, philosopher, statesmen, diplomat, and abolitionist, he did not actually graduate from the finest institutions of higher learning. Benjamin Franklinâs greatest education came not from any type of formal school but instead from his own life and experience.

1543	How do I get negative credit expunged from my credit report? I have paid off some of the creditor through collection agencies but I was told that it will be at least 10 years for it to be off my credit record. I hear there are some credit repair companies out there.
1544	To make a dispute online, you must have recently ordered a copy of your credit report. You can submit a dispute with the credit bureau who provided the credit report. To dispute via mail, write a letter describing the credit report and submit copies of any proof you have. The credit bureau investigates and removes the entry if they find that is indeed an error.
1545	Don't spend your money on those credit repair companies but they are a rip off. You can't get anything off your credit unless its more than 7 yrs old or 10 if its bankruptcy. Just because you paid it off doesn't mean that you can get it taken off the credit report.

1551	Wait out the credit reporting time limit. If all else fails, your only choice is to wait for those negative items to fall off your credit report.

1553	The Senate at that time had 60 Democrats, just enough to pass Obamacare. However after the bill passed the Senate, Democrat Senator Ted Kennedy died. In his place, Massachusetts elected Republican Scott Brown.
1554	This second bill was called the Reconciliation Act of 2010. So the House passed PPACA, the Senate bill, as well as their Reconciliation Act. At this point PPACA was ready for the President to sign, but the Senate still needed to pass the Reconciliation Act from the House.
1555	It was the trickiest legislative move ever accomplished in the Congress. Hereâs my best play-by-play: Obamacare was signed into law in March 2010. If you recall, Nancy Pelosiâs Democratic majority in the House of Representatives was unable to pass their version of a healthcare law. Because all revenue bills have to originate in the House, the Senate found a bill that met those qualifications: HR3590, a military housing bill. They essentially stripped the bill of its original language and turned it into the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), aka Obamacare.
1556	For Immediate Release: WASHINGTON â Legislation dubbed the Deny Americans the Right to Know, or DARK, Act passed the House of Representatives today, but the fight for a more transparent food industry is only just beginning, EWGâs Scott Faber said following the vote.
1557	This bill is an attack on statesâ ability to assure their citizens are informed.â. Pompeoâs bill â christened the âDeny Americans the Right-to-Knowâ or DARK act by critics â would prevent states from adopting GE labeling laws that have gained widespread support over the last two years.
1558	Industry groups that stand to gain the most if the DARK Act becomes law have been some of Pompeoâs biggest campaign contributors. Since 1989, agribusiness has given him nearly $170,000, and the food and beverage industry more than $81,000, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.
1559	âItâs outrageous that some House lawmakers voted to ignore the wishes of nine out of 10 Americans,â said Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs for EWG. âTodayâs vote to deny Americans the right to know whatâs in their food and how itâs grown was a foregone conclusion.
1560	âWe continue to hope that thoughtful food companies that listen to their customers will work with consumer groups to craft a non-judgmental GMO disclosure to put on the back of food packaging. Americans should have the same right as citizens of 64 other countries to know whatâs in their food and how itâs grown.â.
1561	More than 300 organizations, companies and food industry and social justice leaders oppose the DARK Act in the face of massive spending and lobbying by big chemical and food companies. Poll after poll has shown that a large majority of residents of key states and across the country support mandatory GMO labeling.
1562	Connecticut, along with Maine, also passed a law requiring GE labeling. More than 30 other states are taking up legislation to require GE labeling in 2014. Pompeoâs measure would also limit the authority of the federal Food and Drug Administration to compel companies to disclose GE ingredients.
1563	Carpal Tunnel syndrome, or a laceration to the Median Nerve at the wrist, is called a low Median Nerve injury because it occurs in the lower part of the arm (near the wrist). Most of the muscles that are given function by this nerve are not affected by a low nerve injury.

Mentioned in: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
1566	The Median Nerve travels down the front of your arm and enters into the palm of your hand.

1568	The nerve to the subclavius muscle is a small filament that arises from the upper trunk. It descends to the subclavius muscle in front of the subclavian artery and the lower trunk of the plexus. The suprascapular nerve arises from the upper trunk formed by the union of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves.
1569	Median nerve. The median nerve is a nerve in humans and other animals in the upper limb. It is one of the five main nerves originating from the brachial plexus. The median nerve originates from the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus, and has contributions from ventral roots of C5-C7(lateral cord) and C8 & T1 (medial cord).
1570	The brachial plexus (plexus brachialis) is a somatic nerve plexus formed by intercommunications among the ventral rami (roots) of the lower 4 cervical nerves (C5-C8) and the first thoracic nerve (T1).
1571	The median nerve may divide into two nerve bundles in the distal forearm and appear as a bifid median nerve in the carpal tunnel. It has an incidence of ~3%. The median nerve usually divides into two or three branches after exiting the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament that covers the carpal tunnel. These subdivide into digital nerves that supply opposing sides of the digits.

1644	The term âTheory-Theoryâ derives from Adam Morton (1980), who proposed that our everyday understanding of human psychology constitutes a kind of theory by which we try to predict and explain behavior in terms of its causation by beliefs, intentions, emotions, traits of character, and so on.

1650	One of the greatest strengths of behavioral psychology is the ability to clearly observe and measure behaviors. Weaknesses of this approach include failing to address cognitive and biological processes that influence human actions.
1651	Watson's basic premise was that conclusions about human development should be based on observation of overt behavior rather than speculation about subconscious motives or latent cognitive processes. (Shaffer, 2000). Watson's view of learning was based in part on the studies of Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936).

Energy cost can be illustrated in a similar example: a 100-watt (i.e. 0.1 kilowatt) light bulb turned on for 8 hours uses 800 Wâh or 0.8 kWâh.If the energy cost is 25 cents per kilowatt-hour, it would cost 0.1 kW Ã 8 h Ã $0.25/kWâh = $0.20.Whereas individual homes only pay for the kilowatt-hours consumed, commercial buildings and institutions also pay for peak power consumption (the greatest power recorded in a fairly short time, such as 15 minutes).he kilowatt-hour (symbolized kWâh) is a unit of energy equivalent to one kilowatt (1 kW) of power sustained for one hour. One watt is equal to 1 J/s. One kilowatt-hour is 3.6 megajoules, which is the amount of energy converted if work is done at an average rate of one thousand watts for one hour.
1684	The unit that both gas and electricity are measured in is kilowatt hours (kWh). One kWh of gas is approximately equivalent to leaving a small gas hob burner on for an hour. One kWh of electricity is the rough equivalent of running a washing machine for an hour. Standing charge-this is a fixed amount that you are charged each day, regardless of how much gas or electricity you use. 2  Unit rate-this is the price you will pay per unit (kWh) of energy, so it can fluctuate depending on how much energy you use.

The price of electricity in the UK in 2013 averages 17.2 pence per kWh according to updated analysis of CompareMySolar, following last years article.he following graph gives average rates for Low (2100 kWh per year), Medium (3300 kWh) and High (5100 kWh) electricity users that either pay by direct debit (cheaper) or standard credit (more expensive): This gives us the following average price per kWh per energy company 1  : British Gas: 16.6 pence per kWh.
1690	Calculations of these costs at the point of connection to a load or to the electricity grid can be made. The cost is typically given per kilowatt-hour or megawatt-hour. It includes the initial capital, discount rate, as well as the costs of continuous operation, fuel, and maintenance.This type of calculation assists policy makers, researchers and others to guide discussions and decision making.hat method arrives at external costs of electricity from lignite at 10.75 Eurocent/kWh, from hard coal 8.94 Eurocent/kWh, from natural gas 4.91 Eurocent/kWh, from photovoltaic 1.18 Eurocent/kWh, from wind 0.26 Eurocent/kWh and from hydro 0.18 Eurocent/kWh.

1692	Confidence votes 18.3K. The frequency and the amplitude are related in such a way that, the greater the amplitude the greater is the energy. The sound pressure amplitude tells about how loud the tone will be and the frequency (cycles per second) of the oscillation tells how high the sound of the tone will be.
1693	Difference Between Amplitude and Frequency. Amplitude and frequency are two of the basic properties of periodic motions. A proper understanding in these concepts is required in the study of motions such as simple harmonic motions and damped harmonic motions.
1694	Wavelength. 1  Frequency tells us how many waves are passing a point per second, the inverse of time. 2  Wavelength tells us the length of those waves in metres, almost like a displacement. 3  If we multiply these two together, we are really multiplying 1/s and mâ¦ which gives us m/s, the velocity of the wave!
1695	In this article, we are going to discuss what frequency and amplitude are, their definitions, the measurement and dependencies of amplitude and frequency, and finally the difference between amplitude and frequency. Frequency. Frequency is a concept discussed in periodic motions of objects.
1696	Amplitude vs Frequency . Amplitude and frequency are two of the basic properties of periodic motions. A proper understanding in these concepts is required in the study of motions such as simple harmonic motions and damped harmonic motions.
1697	What is the difference between amplitude and frequency? â¢ Amplitude strictly depends on the total energy of the system, whereas frequency of an oscillation depends on the properties of the oscillator itself. â¢ For a given system, the amplitude can be changed but frequency cannot.
1698	Amplitude vs Frequency. Amplitude and frequency are two of the basic properties of periodic motions. A proper understanding in these concepts is required in the study of motions such as simple harmonic motions and damped harmonic motions.
1699	Amplitude decides the intensity ie energy content of the wave and frequency is different right from amplitude. If the maximum amplitude,E, i â¦ s known then the instantaneous amplitude, e, can be found by e=E*sin(2*pi*f*t) where f is the frequency and t is the time in seconds from the start of the sine wave.

1701	amplitude is the height of the wave from the middle point, it can be either from the middle to the bottom, or middle to the top of the wave. the frequency is how frequent the â¦ crests of each wave (the amplitude) pass a given point. so how they relate is, the highest point/lowest point is the crest, and the that is the amplitude is the ends of the crests ===== (In other words, to paraphrase the above remarks, there is no relationship between the amplitude and frequency of a wave.
1702	The fundamental purpose of the board is to preside over something called the Doomsday Clock. The symbolic time piece was created in 1947 as a way to highlight the threat of global nuclear war but has since grown to involve some of the worldâs greatest minds â including 15 Nobel Laureates â who meet to examine the urgent challenges facing humanity.
1703	Just what is the Doomsday Clock? 1:18 The Doomsday Clock is a theoretical indicator of how close humanity is to a doomsday event. Started in 1947, the board of scientists who decide what the clock says has included Einstein, Oppenheimer and is now chaired by theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss.
1704	You can check it at: What is the 'Doomsday Clock'? The Islamic teachings that are found in the Holy Quran or in the words of Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (SAWS), do address the details of The Day of Judgement.
1705	But i will give you a quotations for a better understanding. Similarly, in 1947 the experts from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists magazine of the University of Chicago instituted the so-called âDoomsday Clockâ â a symbolic reference point that has the purpose to show how close the world is to self-destruction.
1706	In 1947, at the start of the Cold War, the clock was set at 23:53, seven minutes before midnight â the symbol for global disaster. Ever since, the clock has been repeatedly readjusted by the directors of the magazine in order to correspond to reality.
1707	The Doomsday Clock: Menacing Metaphor of the Nuclear Age. Pessimism is on the rise. Mercurial politicians, rising nationalism and isolationism, international bluster, a changing climate, mass protests, and many other occurrences are contributing to a generally gloomy mood.
1708	âThe purpose of the Doomsday Clock is to provide a graphical way for people to suddenly think about these existential threats,â Prof Krauss said. âPeople tend to avoid thinking about these existential threats and donât talk about them.â
1709	The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic clock face, representing a countdown to possible global catastrophe (e.g. nuclear war or climate change). It has been maintained since 1947 by the members of the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,[1] who are in turn advised by the Governing Board and the Board of Sponsors, including 18 Nobel Laureates.
1710	Originally Answered: What is the doomsday clock? Does it really matter? The members of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists created the clock as an analogy to how close the world was/is to destruction.
1711	Reflecting this, the doomsday clock was recently moved to 2 minutes 30 seconds, the closest it has been to doomsday in decades. That sounds ominous, but what is the doomsday clock? The doomsday clock was created by The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, a journal founded as a response to atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Most of the founding editors were scientists who helped to develop atomic weapons in the first place. The clock first appeared on the Bulletinâs cover in 1947, and has appeared in the table of contents
1712	Ear infections are less common in adults than in children, but they may be more serious or more difficult to treat. Ear infections are less common in adults than in children, but they may be more serious or more difficult to treat.
1713	One of the reasons children are more likely than adults to get ear infections is that their eustachian tubes are smaller and more horizontal than the tubes in most adults. If you have small eustachian tubes or you have tubes that havenât developed more of a slope, youâre at a higher risk for developing an ear infection.
1714	What is an Ear Infection? Infection can affect the ear canal (otitis externa), the eardrum , or the middle ear (otitis media). Most ear injuries are caused by pressure changes during direct injury (such as a blow to the ear) or sport scuba diving, but, a persistently painful ear may signal an infection that requires treatment.
1715	Chronic ear infection symptoms may be less noticeable than those of acute ear infections. Children younger than 6 months who have a fever or ear infection symptoms should see a doctor. Always seek medical attention if your child has a fever higher than 102Â°F or severe ear pain.
1716	Ear infections are often caused by bacterial infections. But whether you get an outer or middle ear infection depends on how you become infected. Middle ear infection. A middle ear infection often originates from a cold or other respiratory problem. The infection moves to one or both ears through the eustachian tubes.
1717	Seek medical treatment as soon as possible for an examination of the ear if an ear infection is suspected. Seek medical treatment immediately if you experience a sudden loss in hearing in one or both ears (usually occurring over a period of less than 24-48 hours).
1718	Most mild ear infections clear up without intervention. Some of the following methods are effective in relieving the symptoms of a mild ear infection: applying a warm cloth to the affected ear; taking over-the-counter pain medication such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen; using over-the-counter or prescription ear drops to relieve pain
1719	Ear infections may be more common in children than in adults, but grown-ups are still susceptible to these infections. Unlike childhood ear infections, which are often minor and pass quickly, adult ear infections are frequently signs of a more serious health problem.
1720	Symptoms of ear infection include: ear pain, fullness in the ear, hearing loss, ringing in the ear, discharge from the ear, nausea, vomiting, and; vertigo. Symptoms may follow a respiratory infection such as the common cold. Discharge from the ear canal is often caused by the infection known as swimmer's ear (otitis externa). A painful ear with decreased hearing is often the result of otitis media, an middle ear infection.
1721	An ear infection occurs when a bacterial or viral infection affects the middle ear â the sections of your ear just behind the eardrum. Ear infections can be painful because of inflammation and fluid build-up in the middle ear. Ear infections can be chronic or acute. Acute ear infections are painful but short in duration. Chronic ear infections either do not clear up, or they recur many times. Chronic ear infections can cause permanent damage to the middle and inner ear.
1722	Fields of Anthropology. There are now four major fields of anthropology: biological anthropology, cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and archaeology. Each focuses on a different set of research interests and generally uses different research techniques.
1723	In the first topic room, entitled Scientific Underpinnings, you will meet biological anthropologists, learn how evolution serves as a backbone of their studies, and discover how these scientists go about the business of testing a hypothesis in the first place.
1724	A PROCESS of Observation and Deduction... Observation - gatherinâ¦. Evidence supporting and not supporting a theory. - When a hypothesis has been tested and retested over many yeaâ¦. - An intellectual framework that is the result of testing a thâ¦.
1725	Biological Anthropology. Biological (or physical) anthropologists carry out systematic studies of the non-cultural aspects of humans and near-humans. Non-cultural refers to all of those biological characteristics that are genetically inherited in contrast to learned.
1726	Biological Anthropology. The graduate program in biological anthropology at CU Boulder offers training in several areas, including primatology, human biology, and paleoanthropology. We share an interest in human ecology, the broad integrative area of anthropology that focuses on the interactions of culture, biology and the environment.
1727	Where do we come from? Where are we going? These are some of the big questions biological anthropology seeks to answer, using the principles of evolution as a backdrop for formulating and testing hypotheses about humanity's past, present, and future.

1729	Graduate Study in Anthropology. The graduate program in biological anthropology at CU Boulder offers training in several areas, including primatology, human biology, and paleoanthropology. We share an interest in human ecology, the broad integrative area of anthropology that focuses on the interactions of culture, biology and the environment.
1730	Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans.
1731	Biological Anthropology. 1  Biological Anthropology is the study of the evolution and ecology of humans and other primates, grounded in an understanding of evolutionary history and extending to applied subjects such as conservation and human development. The UCL Biological Anthropology section is one of the largest groups of academics in Europe that focuses on these subjects.
1732	Making the world better, one answer at a time. The first President of the United States to live in the White House was John Adams, with his wife Abigail Adams. President Washington laid the cornerstone, but it wasn't finished until the final years of Adams's term. President Jefferson was the first to fully live in the building during his entire presidency.
1733	President John Adams and his wife, Abigail, moved into the White House in 1800, shortly before it was completed. Construction began in 1792.
1734	President Harry S. Truman began a renovation of the building in which everything but the outer walls were dismantled. The reconstruction was overseen by architect Lorenzo Winslow, and the Truman family moved back into the White House in 1952.
1735	There are five living former First Ladies: Rosalynn Carter, wife of Jimmy Carter; Nancy Reagan, widow of Ronald Reagan; Barbara Bush, wife of George H. W. Bush; Hillary Clinton, wife of Bill Clinton; and Laura Bush, wife of George W. Bush. The first First Lady was Martha Washington, married to George Washington.
1736	The Office of the First Lady is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House, and is a branch of the Executive Office of the President. According to the White House and the National First Ladies' Library, there have been forty-five First Ladies and forty-six First Ladyships.
1737	Following Barack Obama 's first inauguration on January 20, 2009, his wife, Michelle Obama, became the forty-sixth official First Lady, succeeding Laura Bush, wife of former President George W. Bush.
1738	One woman who was not married to a President but who is still considered an official First Lady: Harriet Lane, niece of bachelor James Buchanan. The other non-spousal relatives who served as White House hostesses are not recognized by the First Ladies' Library.
1739	The White House was under construction while President George Washington served in office, and because of this he never used it as his residence. President John Adams and his wife Abigail were the first residents when they moved in November 1800, although the White House was still undergoing some final renovations.
1740	Our first president, George Washington, selected the site for the White House in 1791. The cornerstone was laid in 1792 and a competition design submitted by Irish-born architect James Hoban was chosen. After eight years of construction, President John Adams and his wife, Abigail, moved into the unfinished house in 1800.

1752	The skin is often known as the largest organ of the human body. This applies to exterior surface, as it covers the body, appearing to have the largest surface area of all the organs. Moreover, it applies to weight, as it weighs more than any single internal organ, accounting for about 15 percent of body weight.
1753	Answer: Liver. The human liver is a critical organ that plays a major role in the regulation of glycogen storage, decomposition of red blood cells, hormone production, detoxification, and aiding digestion, among other things.
1754	The largest organ of the body is liver . there is a major misconception that largest organ is skin or liver is largest organ inside body.
1755	Skin is the human body's largest organ. A surgeon prepares to transplant skin at a burn victim care center. Skin grafts and transplants help reduce infection and fluid loss (which burn patients with extensive skin loss are especially susceptible to), but transplants carry several risks, including bleeding, infection, and rejection of the graft.
1756	, Human Body: A Mind Boggling machine. The longest bone in the human body is the femur. The largest artery is the aorta and the largest vein is the inferiorvena cava. The largest internal organ is the liver. It is also the heaviest organ, with an average of 1.6 kilograms (3.5 pounds). The largest organ is definitely the skin.
1757	Don't worry, it should be. Your epidermis is the top part of your skin, and your skin is your body's largest and fastest-growing organ. Skin is your body's coat. It protects you. It helps you stay warm when it's cold, and cool when it's hot. Your skin keeps all your insides in, from your heart and lungs to your blood and muscles.
1758	As such, itâs no surprise that the liver, a veritable power house of metabolic processes and critical to our survival, is the largest internal organ by both weight and volumeâthe average adult liver is around 1.44â1.66 kilograms (3.2â3.7 pounds) in weight and approximately 885-1,220 milliliters in volume.
1759	Body organs aren't all internal like the brain or the heart. There's one we wear on the outside. Skin is our largest organâadults carry some 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) and 22 square feet (2 square meters) of it. This fleshy covering does a lot more than make us look presentable.
1760	The skin is the largest organ of the human body and of all mammals. In the average adult it weighs around six pounds, which is nearly twice the weight of the human brain or liâ¦ver. Internally, the largest organ is the liver which weighs around 1.6 pounds. A curmudgeon with years of practice.
1761	The largest internal organ is the liver. It is also the heaviest organ, with an average of 1.6 kilograms (3.5 pounds). The largest external organ, which is also the largest organ in general, is the skin. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_body_part.
1762	By simply attaching a valved holding chamber or spacer to your metered-dose inhaler, you can: 1  Help the medicine move past your mouth and throat and get deep into your lungs where it gets to work. 2  Avoid problems with spraying and breathing at the same time. 3  Avoid breathing the medicine in too fast.
1763	MicroSpacerÂ® is an aerosol spacer device for use with metered dose inhalers (MDI). Using an MDI without a spacer often results in aerosol medication ending up in the mouth, throat, trachea, and even the stomach. In contrast, MicroSpacer very effectively delivers aerosol medication from your MDI directly to the lungs, where it is needed most.
1764	There are several types of spacers and valved holding chambers to choose from. 1  Together, you and your healthcare provider can decide if a spacer or valved holding chamber is right for you and which type will best meet your needs. Here are a few questions to ask your healthcare providers:
1765	General: 1  MicroSpacerÂ® is very easy to use. 2  Cleaning. 3  Wash MicroSpacer daily (or at least weekly) by running it under warm tap water, followed by drying with a soft, lint-free cloth or leaving to dry overnight. 4  Replacement. 5  Multiple MicroSpacers.
1766	MicroSpacer for Metered Dose Inhalers. The MicroSpacerÂ® fits most Metered Dose Inhalers (MDI). Easily drops into bag, pocket or purse, and costs much less than similar devices. Small, convenient to carry, MicroSpacerÂ® is dishwasher safe, latex free and provides anti-static delivery of your medication. MicroSpacer for Metered Dose Inhalers is the spacer device only and the Metered Dose Inhalers are not included.
1767	Features: 1  Optimizes MDI medication benefits by delivering more medication to the lungs. 2  Offers great portability for people on the go. 3  Clinically proven to be as effective as larger spacers, but at much less cost. 4  Compatible with most MDI products. 5  Attaches to MDI in seconds, and easily detaches for cleaning.
1768	Valved holding chambers and spacers are very similar devices; both are plastic tubes that attach to your metered-dose inhaler and are recommended for adults and children. A spacer is a device that is placed on the mouthpiece of your quick relief inhaler. When used, a spacer creates space between your mouth and the medicine. This space helps the medicine break into smaller droplets. The smaller droplets can move easier and deeper into your lungs when you breathe in your medicine.
1769	This asthma inhaler spacer easily drops into a bag, pocket or purse, and costs much less than similar devices. Small, convenient to carry, MicroSpacerÂ® is dishwasher safe, latex free and provides anti-static delivery of your medication.

1772	Next (Stage III), the peptidoglycan in the septum is degraded and the forespore is engulfed by the mother cell, forming a cell within a cell. The activities of the mother cell and forespore lead to the synthesis of the endospore-specific compounds, formation of the cortex and deposition of the coat (Stages IV+V).
1773	In addition, spores that form at higher temperatures will naturally have lower core water content, and thus, have greater wet heat resistance [11] . Dry heat causes significant DNA damage in a vegetative cell [11] . As a result, SASPs play a major role in the dry heat resistance of spores.
1774	The center of the endospore, the core, exists in a very dehydrated state and houses the cell's DNA, ribosomes and large amounts of dipicolinic acid. This endospore-specific chemical can comprise up to 10% of the spore's dry weight and appears to play a role in maintaining spore dormancy.
1775	Heat Resistance. Wet heat resistance is a notable characteristic of spores when suspended in an aqueous medium. Generally, wet heat resistance allows spores to be resistant to temperatures 40 degrees celsius higher than their respective vegetative form [11] . The major determinant of wet heat resistance is the core water content [10] .
1776	When favored nutrients are exhausted, some bacteria may become motile to seek out nutrients, or they may produce enzymes to exploit alternative resources. One example of an extreme survival strategy employed by certain low G+C Gram-positive bacteria is the formation of endospores.
1777	The resilience of an endospore can be explained in part by its unique cellular structure. The outer proteinaceous coat surrounding the spore provides much of the chemical and enzymatic resistance. Beneath the coat resides a very thick layer of specialized peptidoglycan called the cortex.
1778	Endospores are dormant, non-reproductive and enzymatically inert forms of bacterial vegetative cells [1] . Endospore-producing bacteria are more conventionally termed âsporulating bacteriaâ. Sporulating bacteria are derived from the [1] Firmicute phylum and mainly consist of [2] Gram positive bacteria [7] .
1779	Endospores and Epulopiscium: Some Epulopiscium-like surgeonfish symbionts form mature endospores at night. These spores possess all of the characteristic protective layers seen in B. subtilis endospores and also contain large amounts of dipicolinic acid.
1780	1. The endospore is released from the cell and can remain dormant for thousands of years. 2.Germination (The process where the endospores returns to its vegetative state) is triggered by physical or chemical damage to the endospore's coat. 3. The endospore's enzymes break down the extra layers.
1781	The endospore consists of the bacterium's DNA, ribosomes and large amounts of dipicolinic acid. Dipicolinic acid is a spore-specific chemical that appears to help in the ability for endospores to maintain dormancy. This chemical comprises up to 10% of the spore's dry weight.
1782	A lot of these responsibilities will depend on the terms of your consulting contract. For example, some companies may expect a consulting firm to monitor and maintain any security plan that is implemented. In a large organization, you will typically collaborate with IT Project Managers and/or a Security Manager.
1783	So You Want to Be a Security Expert. I regularly receive e-mail from people who want advice on how to learn more about computer security, either as a course of study in college or as an IT person considering it as a career choice. First, know that there are many subspecialties in computer security. You can be an expert in keeping systems from being hacked, or in creating unhackable software. You can be an expert in finding security problems in software, or in networks. You can be an expert in viruses, or policies, or cryptography.
1784	It is the responsibility of the security consultant to provide security to individuals, business enterprises, commercial establishments, factories, retail outlets and many more business types.
1785	1 Enroll yourself in a training program that offers certification as a Security Consultant. 2  A relevant degree can also be obtained, but is not necessary. 3  Graduates in electrical and electronics subjects could obtain special certifications to become a security consultant.
1786	To succeed as a security consultant, you will require a professional certificate backed by a few years of meaningful experience as a full-time security head for a reputed company. It may also be useful for you to possess a university degree. Here is a step by step procedure to become a security consultant. Step1: Obtain a Degree. The first step for you is to obtain a bachelor's degree in any stream of study from a recognized university.
1787	Degree Requirements. All Security Consultants must understand IT security from the ground-up. That means organizations and consulting firms will require â at minimum â a bachelorâs degree in Computer Science, Cyber Security or a related field (e.g. Engineering).
1788	To become a Security Consultant, you should consider gaining your work experience in intermediate-level security jobs such as: 1  Security Administrator. 2  Security Specialist. 3  Security Analyst. 4  Security Engineer. 5  Security Auditor.
1789	1 Do. 2  Computer security is fundamentally a practitioner's art, and that requires practice. 3  This means using what you've learned to configure security systems, design new security systems, and -- yes -- break existing security systems.
1790	One can be a security consultant in a number of ways. Some firms insist on having a license, while for others, it's not mandatory as long as one possesses required qualifications. If one aspires to become a security consultant, then the following guidelines would come in handy: 1  A bachelor's degree in any subject. 2  Enroll yourself in a training program that offers certification as a Security Consultant. 3  A relevant degree can also be obtained, but is not necessary.
1791	A security consultant performs assessments on infrastructures like residential homes, companies, institutions, places of public importance like airports, railway stations and stadiums and suggests optimum security measures to be adopted.
1792	MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drone pilots will be eligible for retention bonuses worth up to $135,000 beginning in fiscal 2016 under a new policy announced by the Air Force.
1793	According to Al Palmer, director of the center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems at the University of North Dakota, drone pilots are paid about $50 an hour, CNN reported.
1794	Pilots who accept the bonus will no longer be eligible for the expanded monthly flight pay James approved in January, Karns said. That change increased the maximum amount 18X drone pilots can get from $650 per month to $1,500, if they keep flying unmanned aircraft beyond their six-year commitments. But pilots getting the bonus will still get the standard $650 monthly flight pay. The extra monthly flight pay adds up to $10,200 per year, meaning that by accepting the new $15,000 annual bonus, these pilots would get an extra $4,800 per year. The bonuses are similar to, but different from the up to $225,000 Aviator Retention Pay bonus that this year became available to some 11U RPA pilots.
1795	Operating a high-tech aircraft by remote control looking for bad guys would seem like a dream job with thousands of hopeful drone pilots lining up too quickly fill any shortage. Working as a drone pilot is no picnic, however.
1796	According to a 2013 report from the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, as many as 100,000 new jobs will be created in the first 10 years after the use of drones becomes legal in US airspace.

The pilots sit in dimly lit, air-conditioned trailers, each staring at glowing video and data screens and toggling a joystick that controls an armed drone flying somewhere in the world.
1800	Some 1,066 pilots fly drones from Creech and other bases, fewer than the 1,281 that the Air Force says it needs to fulfill a Pentagon mandate of 65 daily missions, called combat air patrols. A patrol has one to four aircraft.
1801	As a result, pilots here work up to 12 hours a day. Some are clocking 1,100 flight hours a year, four times the number flown by traditional pilots, according to Pentagon data. âIt does get eye-glazing, there's no ifs, ands or buts about it,â said a drone pilot who was not authorized to speak on the record.

1809	St. Anne. The name Anne derives from the Hebrew, Hannah, meaning âGraceâ. Saint Anne was born in Bethlehem and became the wife of Saint Joachim from Nazareth, in Galilee. Joachim was a shepherd, given the responsibility of supplying sheep for the templeâs sacrifices in Jerusalem. They were both of the royal House of David, and their lives were wholly occupied in prayer and good works.

1812	The ascending aorta when shows a diameter from 3.9 to 4.4 cm we consider as mild ectasia, 4.5 to 4.9 cm moderate ectasia, and when it presents a diameter larger than 4.9 cm we consider aneurysm of the aorta.â. slide 4 of 8.
1813	I was first told that my aorta is slightly dilated at 4.0 cm. There is some variation in the way the term aneurysm is used. For the thoracic aorta, most agree that at a diameter of 4.0 cm it has reached a size that is considered an aneurysm. The word dilated refers to the enlargement of the aorta.
1814	I have an ascending aortic aneurysm. Aneurysmal aortic tissue is thin, weak and fragile. Beta blockers and blood pressure medications are important in reducing the pressure on the fragile aortic tissue and lowering the risk of aneurysm rupture or dissection.
1815	The aorta is the main blood vessel that carries blood to the rest of the body. In patients with Marfan Syndrome, the walls of the aorta are weaker than normal. This can cause the aorta to enlarge and stretch. An abnormal bulge in the wall of the aorta (an aneurysm) may develop. The inner and outer layers of the aortic wall can also separate (a dissection).
1816	An aneurysm results from weakness in the tissue of the aortic wall. There is no way to restore or strengthen this weakened tissue. The purpose of the blood pressure medication is to slow or prevent further enlargement of the aneurysm and protect against dissection or rupture of the aortic wall.
1817	Though the term âmildâ may indicate a lack in the seriousness of the condition, aortic aneurysms are serious. They can rupture and the risk of that happening increases as the size of the aneurysm grows. A rupture is serious because it can cause internal bleeding that is life-threatening.
1818	My aneurysm was found first on an echocardiogram, and then a CT Scan was done. These tests are generally used to evaluate the heart and the aorta. The echocardiogram is used to evaluate the heart valves and the thickness of the heart wall.
1819	Mild aortic ectasia is defined as an enlargement of the aorta that is mild in degree. This condition is associated with aortic aneurysm. This is because, generally, if the aneurysm diameter is greater than 1.5 times a normal aortaâs size, it is known as an aneurysm. slide 2 of 8.
1820	Another reason symptoms might appear is if the aneurysm causes dissection, meaning a tearing in the artery wall. In this case, the patient may experience stroke, abdominal pain, extremities that feel cold or numb and a severe tearing pain in the regions of the back or chest. slide 6 of 8.
1821	Mild aortic enlargement may not cause any noticeable symptoms at first. An enlarged aorta, however, may allow blood to leak back into the heart, due to aortic valve insufficiency. This can cause shortness of breath and a pounding heartbeat. More severe aortic enlargement can further weaken the aortic wall, causing the aneurysm to enlarge or dissect.

1828	Introduction. The Child Support Division of the Office of the Attorney General helps get child support and medical support for dependent children. You may want this assistance for one of the following reasons: 1  You don't have a court order to establish child support payments, and you want one.eginning September 1, 2011, custodial parents will pay a $3 monthly fee in cases that receive registry-only payment processing and record-keeping services through the State Disbursement Unit (SDU) for each month in which a child support payment of more than $3 is received.

1831	This is an easy way for the non-custodial parent to make child support payments. It also provides the non-custodial parent with a record of payments made. If support payments are not deducted from the non-custodial parent's paycheck, they should be paid as directed in the court order.It is very important to keep records of the payments that are made. The Fatherhood Program can help non-custodial parents who have a case with DCSS and are unable to pay child support.f support payments are not deducted from the non-custodial parent's paycheck, they should be paid as directed in the court order.

1832	An electromagnetic field (also EMF or EM field) is a physical field produced by electrically charged objects. It affects the behavior of charged objects in the vicinity of the field. The electromagnetic field extends indefinitely throughout space and describes the electromagnetic interaction.
1833	Exposure to the very high intensity electromagnetic fields found in the immediate vicinity of certain sources such as radar installations and TV or radio transmitters can produce electrical shock or a variety of heating effects, which may range from a sensation of warmth to burns and eventual cataract formation.
1834	Magnetic fields. 1  Electric fields arise from voltage. 2  Their strength is measured in Volts per metre (V/m) 3  An electric field can be present even when a device is switched off.  Field strength decreases with distance from the 1  source. Most building materials shield electric fields to some extent.  Magnetic fields arise from current flows.
1835	Radiofrequency (RF) and microwave (MW) radiation are electromagnetic radiation in the frequency ranges 3 kilohertz (kHz) - 300 Megahertz (MHz), and 300 MHz - 300 gigahertz (GHz), respectively. RF and MW radiation are non-ionizing in that there is insufficient energy to ionize atoms.
1836	Electromagnetic fields at low frequencies. Electric fields exist whenever a positive or negative electrical charge is present. They exert forces on other charges within the field. The strength of the electric field is measured in volts per metre (V/m).
1837	Radiation Safety Index > Magnetic Fields & Radio Frequency. Electrical devices and systems produce two different fields: an electric field like the one produced on the surface of a wool sweater on a dry winter day, and a magnetic field like the fields produced by a compass needle, a small magnet or the earth itself.
1838	Magnetic fields arise from the motion of electric charges. The strength of the magnetic field is measured in amperes per meter (A/m); more commonly in electromagnetic field research, scientists specify a related quantity, the flux density (in microtesla, ÂµT) instead.
1839	Difference Between Electromagnetic Waves and Radio Waves. Electromagnetic waves are a type of wave that is present in nature. The applications of electromagnetic waves are endless. The theory of electromagnetism is a vast field in classical mechanics and in modern physics, as well.
1840	All electromagnetic waves have the same velocity in vacuum. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave decided the energy stored in it. Later it was shown using quantum mechanics that these waves are, in fact, packets of waves. The energy of this packet depends on the frequency of the wave. This opened the field of wave â particle duality of matter.
1841	From a classical perspective in the history of electromagnetism, the electromagnetic field can be regarded as a smooth, continuous field, propagated in a wavelike manner; whereas from the perspective of quantum field theory, the field is seen as quantized, being composed of individual particles.
1842	Electricity gives a wide variety of well-known effects, such as lightning, static electricity, electromagnetic induction and electric current. In addition, electricity permits the creation and reception of electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves.enjamin Franklin conducted extensive research on electricity in the 18th century, as documented by Joseph Priestley (1767) History and Present Status of Electricity, with whom Franklin carried on extended correspondence.
1843	An electric light is a device that produces visible light by the flow of electric current.It is the most common form of artificial lighting and is essential to modern society, providing interior lighting for buildings and exterior light for evening and nighttime activities.efore electric lighting became common in the early 20th century, people used candles, gas lights, oil lamps, and fires. Most electric lighting is powered by centrally generated electric power, but lighting may also be powered by mobile or standby electric generators or battery systems.
1844	Report Abuse. There's no right answer. Electricity has become steadily more available to more people in the world over the last 100 years. There's no one time when it went from generally unavailable to generally available.oes anybody know when electricity became available as a general household power source-as in changed from gas lamps, candles etc. Update: I do not mean when it was invented, I mean when it was available for any household (maybe in a city) to have access to it.
1845	It was in the late 1870s when America's greatest inventor -- Thomas Alva Edison -- developed and built the first electricity generating plant in New York City. Electric lighting came to Chicago in 1880, when the Palmer House Hotel installed electric lights in time for that year's Republican National Convention.Later that year in Philadelphia the first electric lights were strung along a ten-block stretch of Chestnut Street.lectric lighting came to Chicago in 1880, when the Palmer House Hotel installed electric lights in time for that year's Republican National Convention.

1846	The inductor is a conductor, usually a coil of wire, that stores energy in a magnetic field in response to the current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor.The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current.enjamin Franklin conducted extensive research on electricity in the 18th century, as documented by Joseph Priestley (1767) History and Present Status of Electricity, with whom Franklin carried on extended correspondence.
1847	One of the major purposes of the CEB was to promote the use of electricity by industry. By 1936, about 80% of the available supply was used in this sector, although many industrial companies continued to rely on their own oil or gas engines to generate electricity for lighting.Domestic use was originally very limited but gradually expanded from use only by the wealthy.y 1936, about 80% of the available supply was used in this sector, although many industrial companies continued to rely on their own oil or gas engines to generate electricity for lighting.

1851	By 1900, it was clear that electric lighting was as good as gas lighting, and likely to overtake it in popularity. The demand for lighting was, of course, largely at night. Power suppliers found that if they were to meet peak night demand, they needed demand during the day as well, otherwise they over-produced.y 1936, about 80% of the available supply was used in this sector, although many industrial companies continued to rely on their own oil or gas engines to generate electricity for lighting.

1891	There are a variety of booster seats on the market that accommodate children from 40 up to 80 pounds. Several models are weight-rated even higher. Parents should strongly consider using booster seats - even past the age of seven - until their child is tall enough to fit into adult safety belts properly.
1892	One notable exception is the refrigerator. There are several reasons why May is a better time to buy a new fridge, Shelton says. Manufacturers introduce new models in the spring, so retailers tend to cut prices in May on the previous yearâs models by as much as 50% to make room.
1893	When to Buy a New Appliance. When it comes to large appliances, many people choose to use their current ones all the way up until the day they die. While this does ensure maximum use, it doesnât allow you to effectively plan a new appliance purchase when appliance prices are at their lowest.
1894	She'll have a mission! I can't wait to get some new appliances, the stove is nearly 20 years old and looks very dated, I'm tasting a solid surface instead of burners! And I can't wait to have a back-up fridge in the garage, that's where our 15 year old white one will go, for when we entertain or when Woody hunts. Oh, bliss! Extra room.
1895	Thank you for reporting this comment. Yesterday someone at work was looking at the Lowe's flyer from the Sunday paper. They were having a sale this week on appliances, fridge, dishwasher, stove, microwave combo for a set price. Not sure if it's Nationwide, though.
1896	Ready to re-do the laundry room? Or maybe it's simply time to swap out the avocado fridge that's been chugging along since the '70s. While most would-be remodelers fret over where to shop for new household appliances, thrifty Bob Vila wannabes focus on when to shop to get the best bargains.
1897	If you plan ahead, youâll have plenty of time to find a good deal before you desperately need the appliance. This is because there are certain times of year that are best for purchasing washers and dryers, dishwashers, refrigerators, stoves/ranges, and the like.
1898	They're marked down around 50% or even more. Toward the end of the year, many new models are in and vendors are trying to get rid of the discontinued or old models. Also, during the holidays, usually many places have items on sale.
1899	The best time to buy most major household appliances is September and October, when new models hit stores and older models need to be cleared out to make room, says Regina Novickis, consumer expert with Slickdeals.net, a Web site that rates deals and coupons.
1900	For all major appliances (other than air conditioning units), consider timing your purchase to the suggestions below. 1. September and October. The best time to buy most major appliances is during the months of September and October. During these two months, manufacturers unveil their latest models.

Financial Institutions (e.g. banks) use Financial Statements to decide whether to grant a loan or credit to a business. Financial institutions assess the financial health of a business to determine the probability of a bad loan.
1908	With the incorporation of these changes, three categories of funds remain: 1  Governmental funds are those through which most governmental functions are accounted for. 2  Proprietary funds are used to account for a government's ongoing organizations and activities that are similar to those often found in the private sector.
1909	This reduces the number of funds presented on the face of the financial statements and directs the focus on the significant funds of the reporting entity. Major fund reporting is applied only to governmental (i.e., general, special revenue, debt service, capital projects, and permanent funds) and enterprise funds.
1910	Specifically, the information provided by governments should contribute to accountability in the following areas: 1  Financial position and results of operations. 2  Actual financial results compared with adopted budgets. 3  Compliance with finance-related laws, rules and regulations. 4  Efficiency and effectiveness of operations.
1911	In addition, school-level financial information is often related to non-financial information (e.g., student achievement) in published reports and is used for comparison purposes. As a result, school districts must increasingly focus on ensuring that financial information reported by schools is accurate and consistent across the district.
1912	Pregnant women can have some light irregular bleeding during pregnancy, but it should not be like a ânormalâ period. Some women can confuse this for their period because often it can come right around the time she was expecting her normal period.The irregular bleeding or spotting that can occur during pregnancy is often a dark brown or a light pinkish color. It should not be enough bleeding to fill pads or tampons over a few days.If you are bleeding enough to fill pads and tampons, then this would be a good indication that you are probably not pregnant. negative result can mean that you are not pregnant, you took the test too early, or you took the test wrong. Pregnancy tests vary in their sensitivity (how soon they can detect the hormone hCG), and you may not have given your body enough time to produce enough hCG hormones that will show up on the test.
1913	Miscarriage-About 20-30% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Bleeding or spotting can be an early sign of miscarriage. Bleeding or spotting during pregnancy does not always mean that the woman will not go on to have a healthy pregnancy but it is reason for concern.A miscarriage often starts with light spotting that turns to heavy bleeding.wenty to twenty-five percent of women have bleeding or spotting during pregnancy. The bleeding is generally not as heavy a regular period. However, if a woman did not know that she was pregnant, she may assume the bleeding was just a light period.
1914	The BabyCenter Editorial Team. No. You can't have your menstrual period while you're pregnant. Some women do have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. Some even report intermittent bleeding that seems like a regular period to them.But vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is not the same thing as menstruation.he BabyCenter Editorial Team.

1915	1 No. You can not and will not have a period during pregnancy. 2  There may be spotting which may last 1-4 days and is normal for your first child or your fifth. 3  It does not matter. 4  If you think you are pregnant and have spotting then wait a week and test. A period is to drain your menstrual blood, lining and eggs, which in pregnancy are needed to protect the fertilized egg or eggs. 2  So there for you CAN NOT be pregnant and have your period. 3  I'll explain why some women THINK they are on their period.
1916	It is very possible and quite normal to have some 'bleeding' early in pregnancy. I had a very good friend who was 6 1/2 months pregnant before she found out because she was having normal 'periods' (she was heavy set which was why she didn't notice any weight gain or other symptoms).est Answer: You can have bleeding, but not an actual period. Women mistakanly call the bleeding a period when it's not. A period is the disposal of the unused egg and uterus lining.

1922	1 Possibly the first cloned mammal was a mouse in 1986, in the Soviet Union. 2  However, the cloning was done from an embryo cell, while the sheep Dolly in 1996 was cloned from an adult cell.
1923	Scientists had cloned endangered species before, but not one that had officially died out. (Related: Scientists Clone First Endangered Species: A Wild Sheep [October 29, 2001].).
1924	Dolly was the first clone produced from a cell taken from an adult mammal. The production of Dolly showed that genes in the nucleus of such a mature differentiated somatic cell are still capable of reverting to an embryonic totipotent state, creating a cell that can then go on to develop into any part of an animal.
1925	1 However, the cloning was done from an embryo cell, while the sheep Dolly in 1996 was cloned from an adult cell. 2  The first mouse from adult cells, Cumulina, was born in 1997 at the University of Hawai'i at MÄnoa in the laboratory of Ryuzo Yanagimachi using the Honolulu technique.
1926	1 Gene, the first cloned calf in the world was born on February 7, 1997 at the American Breeders Service facilities in Deforest, Wisconsin, USA. 2  Later it was transferred and kept at the Minnesota Zoo Education Center. 3  Three more cloned calves were born in 1998.
1927	A species of wild cattle, the first endangered species to be cloned. In 2001 at the Trans Ova Genetics in Sioux Center, Iowa, USA, a cloned Gaur was born from a surrogate domestic cow mother. However, the calf died within 48 hours.
1928	An extinct animal has been resurrected by cloning for the first timeâthough the clone died minutes after birth. Findings revealed January 23 in the journal Theriogenology describe the use of frozen skin in 2003 to clone a bucardo, or Pyrenean ibex, a subspecies of Spanish ibex that went extinct in 2000.

1929	Dolly was remarkable in being the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell. This was a major scientific achievement as it demonstrated that the DNA from adult cells, despite having specialised as one particular type of cell, can be used to create an entire organism.
1930	Dolly the sheep, as the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell, is by far the world's most famous clone. However, cloning has existed in nature since the dawn of life. From asexual bacteria to âvirgin birthsâ in aphids, clones are all around us and are fundamentally no different to other organisms.
1931	How Dolly was cloned. Animal cloning from an adult cell is much more difficult than from an embryonic cell. So when scientists working at the Roslin Institute in Scotland produced Dolly, the only lamb born from 277 attempts, it was a major news story around the world.
1932	Weil is less enthusiastic about white, or button, mushrooms, a species of mushroom that also includes Portobellos and criminis. âButton mushrooms do possess some health benefits, but not the general health benefits found in Asian mushrooms,â Weil says. Weil also says that these commonly available mushrooms contain natural substances called agaritines, which studies show may increase the risk of tumors in animals.
1933	Andrew Weil, MD, is a huge fan of mushrooms. A longtime mushroom hunter, he seeks them out because of their taste and health benefits. And Weil, founder and director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center, likes to share his enthusiasm for these fungi.
1934	In fact, as the authors of a recent Nutrition Today article noted, mushroomsâ nutrient and culinary characteristics suggest it may be time to re-evaluate food groupings and health benefits in the context of three separate food kingdoms: plants/ botany; animals/zoology and fungi/mycology.
1935	For thousands of years, Eastern cultures have revered mushroomsâ health benefits.1 Mushrooms have long been celebrated as a source of powerful nutrients, but they can also help Americans meet the dietary recommendations set forth in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines and Institute of Medicineâs Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D.
1936	For the maximum health benefits of mushrooms, I strongly advise against eating these or any other types of mushrooms raw, whether theyâre wild or cultivated. If youâre going to eat them cook them well, at high temperatures, by sauteeing, broiling, or grilling. Heat breaks down many of the toxic constituents.
1937	Health Benefits of Portobello Mushrooms. Of the 140,000 fungi known to produce mushrooms, only about 100 of them are being investigated for possible health-promoting benefits.
1938	You can buy dried, ground mushrooms and use them to make tea if you donât mind the bitterness. Otherwise, buy reishi tablets, liquid extracts or capsules, which are available online and in health food stores and follow the recommended dosage. Take reishi every day for at least two months to see what it can do for you.
1939	Mushrooms are a good source of B vitamins, including riboflavin, niacin, and pantothenic acid, which help to provide energy by breaking down proteins, fats and carbohydrates2. B vitamins also play an important role in the nervous system.
1940	ââ¦Mushroomsâ nutrient and culinary characteristics suggest it may be time to reevaluate food groupings and health benefits in the context of 3 separate food kingdoms: plants/botany, animals/zoology, and fungi/mycology.
1941	Procedures: 1  Clean mushrooms with a damp cloth and remove the stems. 2  In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, water, honey, garlic, cayenne pepper, and olive oil and drizzle it over the mushrooms. 3  Prepare a charcoal grill, gas grill, or broiler to medium heat.
1942	Approximately 100 types of human papillomavirus infection (HPV) have been identified, at least 40 of which can infect the genital area (758). Most HPV infections are self-limited and are asymptomatic or unrecognized. Most sexually active persons become infected with HPV at least once in their lifetime (533,759).
1943	Vaccines: Prevention, not a Cure. While the type of HPV that causes genital warts is consider âlow risk,â there are other HPV types referred to as âhigh-risk,â as infection with these types can lead to the development of cervical cancer.
1944	HPV Treatment. There is no cure for human papillomavirus (HPV). However, there is treatment for the changes the virus can cause to the cervix, as well as treatment for the warts that can occur with an infection (both genital and nongenital).
1945	HPV (human papillomavirus) is a sexually transmitted virus. It is passed on through genital contact (such as vaginal and anal sex). It is also passed on by skin-to-skin contact. At least 50% of people who have had sex will have HPV at some time in their lives. HPV is not a new virus.
1946	When the HPV infection does not clear, genital warts, precancers, and cancers of the cervix, anus, penis, vulva, vagina, head, and neck might develop. The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer.
1947	Certain types of HPV infection cause cervical cancers. More than 100 varieties of human papillomavirus (HPV) exist. Different types of HPV infection cause warts on different parts of your body. For example, some types of HPV infection cause plantar warts on the feet, while others cause warts that mostly appear on the face or neck. Most HPV infections don't lead to cancer. But some types of genital HPV can cause cancer of the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina (cervix). Other types of cancers, including cancers of the anus, penis, vagina, vulva and back of the throat (oropharyngeal), have been linked to HPV infection.
1948	There are over 100 different kinds of HPV and not all of them cause health problems. Some kinds of HPV may cause problems like genital warts. Some kinds of HPV can also cause cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, or anus. Most of these problems are caused by types 6, 11, 16 or 18.
1949	A cure for HPV! Satisfaction guaranteed! No more outbreaks! If youâve had an HPV diagnosis, you may have seen claims like this in your search for information on the Internet and elsewhere, often written in large bold type.
1950	Certain factors may affect the treatment for HPV that your healthcare provider recommends, including whether symptoms are present and what you want and expect. Treating HPV: An Overview. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an extremely common type of virus that infect humans.
1951	This is why experts say there is no âcureâ for HPV, as the virus may still be present even though there are no signs of infection, like pre-cancerous lesions or genital warts. Some websites tout nutritional or herbal supplements that are claimed to either cure the virus or speed natural clearance.
1952	Once in Law Land, one of the first (among many) perplexing metrics was law firm profitably. How could it be that on average the reported profits for the AmLaw 200 is 36.5% (median of 35.0%) â even after The Great Reset? There were even some firms reporting profits in the 60% range.
1953	Average receipts per lawyer reported by participating firms totaled. $432,242, representing a decrease of 4% from the prior year. Overhead expenses. also decreased by 4% from the prior year to $161,904 per lawyer which, when. combined with the revenue decrease of 4%, had a net negative effect on law firm.
1954	According to a 2014 Gartner Research study, âcompanies spent on average 10.2% of their annual 2014 revenue on overall marketing, with 50% of companies planning to increase [in 2015] to an average of 10.4%.â Ten percent â the magic number you will likely hear whenever you ask how much of your revenue you should spend on marketing.
1955	In general, pricing ranges from a low of 75% of sales for firms. under $50K in revenue to 130% for larger firms in excess of $1M in sales.. SDE should be 40% to 60% of gross revenue. The higher the percent of SDE, the more valuable the practice. Other important.
1956	All figures are pre-tax profit as a percentage of revenue. We chose this metric as it seems most directly comparable to what Law Land figures since, as we all know, law firms themselves pay no taxes: Johnson + Johnson: 21.0%. Colgate: 20.5%.
1957	For example, a firm of three partners may determine that each will share in the net profit by allocating 45 percent, 30 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The gross fees collected total $650,000; with overhead at 42 percent, the net profit to be distributed is $377,000.
1958	2012 Survey of Law Firm Economics Executive Summary, Page 7. The average amount of unbilled time for non-contingent fee matters per. lawyer for all participating law firms is $54,404, and the average for all size law. firms fluctuates in a narrow range between $46,000 and $68,000.
1959	And they believe in what they are selling. Just take a look at their numbers. Salesforce invests 53% of their revenue into sales and marketing! 53%! Think about that for a minute. Thatâs just over half of the $4.1 billion in revenue generated in 2014.
1960	For instance, in the firm of A,B & C, A may have 40 units, B may have 35 units and C may have 25 units. A will receive 40/100ths of net profit. B will receive 35/100ths and C will receive 25/100ths. The following year, the allocations of B and C are increased: A receives 40 units, B 40 units and C 30 units.
1961	Those with 76 to 150 lawyers saw revenue. per lawyer decline by 10 percent. For firms of 150 lawyers or more, the drop was 9. percent. At the other end of the size spectrum, firms of one to nine lawyers. experienced a sharp 17 percent drop in RPL.
1962	Most of the stretches you see and do are likely static-passive stretches. Static-passive stretches are the most common stretches and the easiest to perform. If executed with good technique, these stretches are effective in improving flexibility and range of motion.
1963	1. Straight Legged Toe Touches. This stretch calls for keeping your legs straight while you bend over and touch your toes, with a bent spine. Stretching in this manner can be dangerous. Straight legged toe touches encourage hyperextension of the knees, which occurs when ligaments become stretches, and can lead to knee injury.
1964	Stretching to prevent soreness. If you spend 15 minutes stretching in the hopes of preventing post-workout soreness, you may be wasting your time. Stretching before exercise doesn't do anything to lessen muscle soreness, finds a BMJ study.
1965	5 Stretches You Should Never Do. gettyimages-537332564-jaaakworks-opener.jpg. There's a lot to like about stretching. Whether it's a little morning yoga to wake you up, or simple stretches to calm your nerve pain, stretching is beneficial in countless ways.
1966	Although the benefits of stretching are many, is not for everyone. People who have suffered an acute muscle strain should avoid placing further stress on the muscle through stretching activities. The injured muscle should be given time to rest. Stretching muscle fibers in the acute period can result in further injury.
1967	Static stretching means a stretch is held in a challenging but comfortable position for a period of time, usually somewhere between 10 to 30 seconds. Static stretching is the most common form of stretching found in general fitness and is considered safe and effective for improving overall flexibility.
1968	Prolonged stretchingâor more than 60 seconds per muscle groupâcould decrease performance before some activities, says David Behm, PhD, a professor of human kinetics at Canada's Memorial University. Here are five stretches you should reconsiderâor avoid altogether.
1969	Physical Therapy. Stretching is the deliberate lengthening of muscles in order to increase muscle flexibility and joint range of motion. Stretching activities are an important part of any exercise or rehabilitation program. They help warm the body up prior to activity thus decreasing the risk of injury as well as muscle soreness.
1970	This is an excerpt from Full-Body Flexibility, Second Edition by Jay Blahnik. Stretching Techniques and Terms. First letâs review a few important techniques and terms. Even if youâre familiar with stretching, itâs a good idea to double-check your knowledge of this information.

2151	Part 2 of 3: Looking After a Moderately Sprained Wrist. 1. Take an over-the-counter medication. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin can be short-term solutions to help you deal with significant pain or inflammation in your wrist.
2152	A sprained wrist is an injury to the ligaments that connect the small bones of the wrist (called carpal bones) together. The most common ligament injured in the wrist is the scapho-lunate ligament, which connects the scaphoid bone to the lunate bone.
2153	DESCRIPTION. A sprain is an injury to a ligament. Ligaments are the connective tissues that connect bones to bones; they could be thought of as tape that holds the bones together at a joint (see Figure 1). The most common ligament to be injured in the wrist is the scapho-lunate ligament (see Figure 2). It is the ligament between two of the small bones in the wrist, the scaphoid bone and the lunate bone. There are many other ligaments in the wrist, but they are less frequently injured. Sprains can have a wide range of severity; minor sprains may have minimal stretch of the ligaments, and more severe sprains may represent complete tears of the ligament(s).
2154	Wrist sprains have a wide range of severity depending on the degree of stretch or tearing to the ligament. The severity of your wrist sprain will dictate how you look after it at home or whether you need to see a health professional.
2155	Sprained wrist symptoms. Symptoms of a wrist sprain vary depending on the extent of the injury and the location of the sprain. Sudden pain in the wrist will be felt at the time of injury and in more severe wrist sprains a tearing or popping feeling may be felt.
2156	2. Ice your sprained wrist. The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all minor musculoskeletal injuries, including wrist sprains. Apply the ice to the most tender part of your wrist in order to reduce the swelling and pain.
2157	In order to heal a sprained wrist quickly, you must follow the RICE principle for sprains -- rest, ice, compression and elevation -- to facilitate healing so you can get back in the game again. Visit your doctor so she can look at the sprain and analyze its severity.
2158	Wrist sprain explained. A wrist sprain is quite a common injury, which usually occurs after a fall onto an outstretched hand. Other accidents or impacts can cause a sprained wrist, although it usually involves the wrist being bent either forwards or back. A sprained wrist doesn't usually occur as an overuse injury.
2159	Rest and immobilize your wrist for faster healing. A sprained wrist is a common fall-related injury, since you instinctively extend your hand and often land with your weight on your wrist. If you're an athlete, a sprained wrist can put a major wrench in your plans when you're taken out of the game for a few weeks.
2160	Wrist sprains can vary in severity. A mild or grade 1 wrist sprain may involve the ligament being stretched. Moderate or grade 2 injuries are partial tears of a ligament and severe grade 3 injuries are full ruptures of one or more ligaments. Grade 3 injuries may also involve an avulsion fracture where a fragment of bone is pulled off with the ligament.
2161	The Glycemic Index (GI) refers to the effect carbohydrates have on blood glucose. If the carbohydrate increases blood glucose by a large amount, it is considered a high glycemic index food.If, on the other hand, it increases blood glucose a small amount, it is a low glycemic index food.A carbohydrate's GI is determined by its rate of digestion and absorption in the body.For example, foods that have a high degree of soluble fiber, such as whole grains, have lower GI values.f the carbohydrate increases blood glucose by a large amount, it is considered a high glycemic index food. If, on the other hand, it increases blood glucose a small amount, it is a low glycemic index food.
2162	The Glycemic Index âor GI, for shortâis a system that ranks foods by how they affect your blood sugar levels. Low-glycemic index foods (less than 55) produce a gradual rise in blood sugar levels that's easy on the body.Foods between 55 and 70 are intermediate-glycemic index foods.Foods with high-glycemic index numbers (more than 70) make blood sugar levels as well as insulin levels spike fast. We now realize that's a health threat.oods between 55 and 70 are intermediate-glycemic index foods. Foods with high-glycemic index numbers (more than 70) make blood sugar levels as well as insulin levels spike fast.
2163	The Glycemic Index: High GI vs Low GI. The glycemic index classifies carbs based on how quickly and how high they raise blood sugar levels when compared to pure glucose (sugar), although white bread is now used as the reference food in its place.ome common foods with a high GI rating include white bread, white rice, corn flakes, crackers and most sugary and/or highly processed snack foods. A carbohydrate with a low glycemic index (low GI) breaks down more slowly therefore causing a much slower and more gradual release of glucose into the bloodstream.
2164	Not all Carbohydrate foods are equal. The Glycemic Index (GI) is a relative ranking of carbohydrate in foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels.Carbohydrates with a low GI value (55 or less) are more slowly digested, absorbed and metabolised and cause a lower and slower rise in blood glucose and, therefore insulin levels.ï»¿ot all Carbohydrate foods are equal. The Glycemic Index (GI) is a relative ranking of carbohydrate in foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels.
2165	Quite simply: A carbohydrate with a high glycemic index (high GI) breaks down quickly during digestion and therefore releases glucose into the bloodstream rapidly. Some common foods with a high GI rating include white bread, white rice, corn flakes, crackers and most sugary and/or highly processed snack foods.A carbohydrate with a low glycemic index (low GI) breaks down more slowly therefore causing a much slower and more gradual release of glucose into the bloodstream.ome common foods with a high GI rating include white bread, white rice, corn flakes, crackers and most sugary and/or highly processed snack foods.

2166	Purpose. The purpose of a glycemic index (GI) diet is to eat carbohydrate-containing foods that are less likely to cause large increases in blood sugar levels. The diet is a means to lose weight and prevent chronic diseases related to obesity such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. glycemic index diet is an eating plan based on how foods affect your blood sugar level. The glycemic index is a system of assigning a number to carbohydrate-containing foods according to how much each food increases blood sugar.

2169	Developed in 1981, the glycemic index reflects the extent to which carbohydrate-containing foods raise a personâs blood sugar and subsequent need for insulin. The idea is that low glycemic foods are better for health, warding off diabetes and weight gain, because the carbs they contain are digested at a slower rate.The dogma out there is that a high glycemic index is bad,â said Dr. Robert Eckel, a past president of the American Heart Association and a professor at the University of Colorado, who was not involved in the research. âI hope that ultimately the glycemic index will be left on the shelf.â.
2170	Glycemic index is a number. It gives you an idea about how fast your body converts the carbs in a food into glucose. Two foods with the same amount of carbohydrates can have different glycemic index numbers. The smaller the number, the less impact the food has on your blood sugar. 1  55 or less = Low (good).2  56- 69 = Medium. 3  70 or higher = High (bad).ring down the overall glycemic index of a meal by combining a high-glycemic index food with foods that have lower ones. Your age, how active you are, and how fast you digest food also affect how your body reacts to carbs.
2171	We refer to physical stressors--the tangible and measurable stressors -- as the tiger in your path: 1  accident/trauma. 2  alcohol in excess. 3  circadian light-dark cycle/rhythms. 4  food. 5  infection/virus. 6  injury. 7  medication. 8  seasonal change. 9  poison. 10  surgery. 11  temperature extremes. 12  tobacco. 13  toxin. 14  travel.
2172	A general term for any factor that increases a personâs mental or physical stress; virtually all stressors can be described as related to environment (e.g., inadequate housing) or personal (e.g., health related, sexual, social or related to work).
2173	Two broad categories of stressors. A stressor is anything that causes the release of stress hormones. There are two broad categories of stressors: Physiological (or physical) stressors and Psychological Stressors.
2174	Psychological stress occurs when you are under pressure or having difficulty coping with a situation or stimulus. Think of it as your emotional response to stressful events. The anxiety and incompetence that you felt as a result of receiving a 'D' on your midterm exam is an example of psychological stress.
2175	Stressor. A stimulus or event that provokes a stress response in an organism. Stressors can be categorized as acute or chronic, and as external or internal to the organism. Mentioned in: General Adaptation Syndrome.
2176	In today's fast-paced world, women are experiencing more stress at every stage of their lives than ever before. Juggling job pressures, family schedules, money issues, career and educational advancement and child and eldercare concerns are only a few of the common stressors confronting women.
2177	A HealthyWomen answered. Stressors are external events, including pressures in people's lives such as divorce, marriage, children, work and money. The experience of stress, however, is related to how you respond to these stressors. One person's stressor can be another person's motivator.
2178	TIPS. An easy way to remember the difference between the two categories of stressor is that absolutely everyone exposed to an absolute stressor will find it stressful. For a relative stressor, situations are relatively stressful only for some.
2179	Lesson Summary. Any event or stimulus that requires you to change in some way has the potential to cause stress. Psychological stress is what you feel when you are under pressure or having difficulty coping with a situation or stimulus. Psychological stressors are the things that cause psychological stress, and as far as we know, can only be experienced by human beings.

2206	Massachusetts fell from 2.8 in 1992 to 2.4 in 1994, while Connecticut fell from 3.1 to 2.8. Nevada once again had the highest divorce rate in the country, even though it experienced the most marked drop in divorce rates during the two-year period. Nevada fell from 11.4 in 1992 to 9.0 in 1994. The divorce rate per 1,000 population for the entire United States was 4.6 in 1994, down from 4.8 in 1992.

2211	Clay roof tile has been used for centuries worldwide and for good reason. Both clay roof tile and its modern partner, concrete, are not only beautiful but also extremely durable. With proper building design and installation, tile roofs can last 50 to 100 years or more. They do not rot in wet climates and are not susceptible to destruction by pests. They can be used in any climate or region and can withstand the severest weather conditions, including fire, wind, and snow.
2212	Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: About 15-20 years for the standard asphalt shingles. You can pay more to get some that are supposed to last longer though. I live in Florida too and we replaced our roof when it was about 16 1/2 years old. It also depends on if there is a lot of debris on your roof, or if you keep it cleaned off. If there is a lot of debris up there it keeps the shingles wet after it rains and they will deteriorate faster.
2213	heres the honest answer: A 20 yr. asphault/fiberglass shingle in so. florida will last 12-14 years, i dosent matter where you live 20 yr, shingles doesnt last 20 years. A`30 year will not last 30 years. Go with a metal roof, more bang for the buck, lots if choices.
2214	Roofs: Slate, copper and tile roofs can last more than 50 years. Homeowners with wood shake roofs should expect them to last about 30 years, while fiber cement shingles last about 25 years and asphalt shingle/composition roofs last about 20 years, the NAHB found. Climate and weather conditions, such as snow, hail and hurricanes, can cut the life span of all types of roofs.
2215	Decks: Because of weather, the life span of a deck varies. In optimal conditions, a wood deck can last 20 years, the NAHB study found. A deck can last 20 to 25 years in dry areas, but is likely to last only 10 to 15 years in the South, where there is more rain and humidity.
2216	Metal roofing materials can last for decades without degrading in appearance or function. The oldest metal roofs in the world are over 120 years old and are still in fairly good condition. Paint and anti-rust technologies increase a metal roofâs lifespan drastically and make metallic roofs an excellent long-term investment. Residential metal roofs typically have a rated lifespan of 50 years or more. This is outstanding compared to the 15-year average lifespan of other materials.
2217	Metal Roof Lifespan. Ultimately, m etal roofs are excellent long-lasting options with excellent and low maintenance needs. When you buy a new metal roof, you will probably be buying the last roof that your home ever needs.
2218	Floors: Wood floors last 100 years or more, as do marble and slate floors if they are maintained well. Tile floors can last 75 to 100 years, and terrazzo lasts more than 75 years. Linoleum lasts about 25 years and vinyl up to 50 years, while laminate floors have a life expectancy of 15 to 25 years. Most carpet needs to be replaced every eight to 10 years, even if itâs maintained well.
2219	Metal roofing prices are fairly low, and many homeowners are considering metal roofs as a long-lasting, great-looking option that improves home energy consumption. If youâre considering metal roofing, you might wonder how long metal roofs last and what type of maintenance your new roof will require.
2220	However, both concrete and clay tile outlast most other roofing materials, with manufacturers offering warranties of 50 years or more. In fact, in Asia and Europe, many structures with clay roof tiles have remained not simply intact but also functional and beautiful for centuries.

2241	The Agaricus Blazei Murill Mushroom. Over 500,000 people have turned to the Agaricus blazei mushroom to support a healthy immune system in order to fight off minor and major health challenges.
2242	Cultivation of Agaricus Blazei. This mushroom was first identified to modern science in 1917 from a specimen found in Louisiana by the mycologist R. Murrill. It has been found on the grasslands of Florida and South Carolina, but is generally thought to be extremely rare in nature.
2243	This sounds far-fetched to me. Agaricus blazei, sometimes called Agaricus blazei Murrill, is a medicinal mushroom known in Japan as himematsutake; in Brazil, where much of the worldâs supply is grown, as cogumelo do sol or medicinel; and in the United States as the almond portobello or Royal Sun Agaricus.
2244	The mushroom was found to be rich in immune-modulating substances such as Î²-glucans and proteoglycans, and presented anti-infection and anti-tumor effects in animal studies. Currently, Agaricus blazei Murill remains under intense investigation, and the results are published in major scientific journals.
2245	â March 17, 2014. Agaricus blazei, sometimes called Agaricus blazei Murrill, is a medicinal mushroom known in Japan as himematsutake; in Brazil, where much of the worldâs supply is grown, as cogumelo do sol or medicinel; and in the United States as the almond portobello or Royal Sun Agaricus.
2246	Why choose Atlas Worldâs Agaricus blazei. Atlas Worldâs patented strain of Agaricus blazei Murill (H1X1), was developed by expert mycologists. H1X1 is the product of two parent strains, one cultivated in northern California known as SBRFG, and another parent strain cultivated in Japan known as I-101.
2247	Agaricus subrufescens forms fruitbodies singly or in clusters in leaf litter in rich soil, often in domestic habitats. Originally described from the northeastern United States and Canada, it has been found growing in California, Hawaii, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Philippines and Brazil.
2248	Agaricus subrufescens (syn. Agaricus blazei, Agaricus brasiliensis or Agaricus rufotegulis) is a species of mushroom, commonly known as almond mushroom, mushroom of the sun, God's mushroom, mushroom of life, royal sun agaricus, jisongrong or himematsutake (Chinese: æä»æ¾è¸, Japanese: å§«ã¾ã¤ãã, princess matsutake) and by a number of other names.
2249	The history of Agaricus blazei Murill is tightly linked to the mountain village Piedade, located within the Atlantic rain forest, about one hundred kilometers west of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Agaricus blazei Murill was originally found in Piedade, a small village located in the mountainous region of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
2250	Agaricus subrufescens was first described by the American botanist Charles Horton Peck in 1893. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was cultivated for the table in the eastern United States. It was discovered again in Brazil during the 1970s, and misidentified as Agaricus blazei Murrill, a species originally described from Florida.
2251	Delivery When You Have Gestational Diabetes. When youâre delivering your baby, the doctor will watch your blood glucose level. If your level goes too high during labor, the baby may release more insulin in response. That increases the risk of the baby developing low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) after birth.
2252	Gestational Diabetes. Abnormal maternal glucose regulation occurs in 3-10% of pregnancies, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which is defined as glucose intolerance of variable degree with onset or first recognition during pregnancy, accounts for 90% of cases of diabetes mellitus (DM) in pregnancy.
2253	Gestational diabetes sometimes develops when a woman is pregnant. Itâs when the blood glucose level (blood sugar level) of the mother goes too high during pregnancy. Having an elevated blood glucose level during pregnancy can cause problems for your babyâif itâs left untreated.
2254	High blood glucose, also called blood sugar, can harm your baby during the first weeks of pregnancy, even before you know you are pregnant. If you have diabetes and are already pregnant, see your doctor as soon as possible to make a plan to manage your diabetes.
2255	Diabetes and Pregnancy. Diabetes is often diagnosed in women during their childbearing years and can affect the health of both the mother and her unborn child. Poor control of diabetes during pregnancy increases the chances for birth defects and other problems for the baby. It can cause serious complications for the woman, also.
2256	Gestational diabetes happens when your body can't make enough insulin during pregnancy. Insulin is a hormone made in your pancreas, an organ located behind your stomach. Insulin helps your body use glucose for energy and helps control your blood glucose levels.
2257	Without enough insulin, you can build up too much glucose in your blood, leading to a higher-than-normal blood glucose level and perhaps gestational diabetes. The elevated blood glucose level in gestational diabetes is caused by hormones released by the placenta during pregnancy.
2258	Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy. Diabetes means your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Your body uses glucose for energy. Too much glucose in your blood is not good for you or your baby. Gestational diabetes is usually diagnosed during late pregnancy.
2259	Hormonal and other changes in your body during pregnancy affect your blood glucose levels, so you might need to change how you manage your diabetes. Even if youâve had diabetes for years, you may need to change your meal plan, physical activity routine, and medicines.
2260	Pregnancy if You Have Diabetes. If you have diabetes and plan to have a baby, you should try to get your blood glucose levels close to your target range before you get pregnant. Staying in your target range during pregnancy, which may be different than when you arenât pregnant, is also important.
2261	This occurs because you don't receive adequate stimulation to the bone without a tooth root. The same occurs with dentures that are not implant-supported. The longer you wait to get dental implants, the more likely it is that your jawbone may lack the integrity to get implants in the future without a dental bone graft. If you are in London and looking for a dental implant specialist then Pro Dental Clinic London is place best for you.
2262	People get dental implants due to many reasons. A few of the reasons are given below: Better appearance. Though artificial, but dental implants look like your own teeth. They become permanent as they are designed in a way to get fuse with bone. Improve verbal communication.
2263	Reasons to Consider Dental Implants as your Tooth Replacement Option:-. 1. Stop your teeth from shifting into the empty space - When you lose a tooth, the surrounding teeth will eventually begin moving to fill in the space. This can cause a number of dental complications.
2264	A dental implant restores the lost tooth so that it looks same and functions like a natural tooth. It allows you to stop worry and enjoy life. Dr. Anil Yadav will explain why do people get dental implants. You can watch more content on Health related issues and also talk to the doctors and consult the doctor online on your phone only on SYMPLER.
2265	If you need an MRI, you may first need a simple procedure to briefly take out the magnet in the cochlear implant. But more medical facilities can do these imaging tests without removing the magnet. Thereâs also a type of cochlear implant that has a magnet you don't need to take out in order to have an MRI.
2266	How do I know if the implant is a good choice for me? If you have severe or profound hearing loss, a team of experts at a cochlear implant center can help you decide if the device and surgery will work for you.
2267	As commonly, once a tooth is removed from the oral cavity, it canât be replaced naturally. So In dental implant mechanism, dentist place artificial tooth into the vacant oval cavity . If you want to read in detail about Dental Implants you may visit this page Dental Implants and Dental Care in Austin, TX .
2268	If you're very hard of hearing or deaf, a cochlear implant may help you get back the sounds you miss. It isn't a hearing aid, which makes sounds louder. Itâs a small device that a doctor puts in your ear through surgery.
2269	Thus, to avoid the embarrassment of going about with a missing tooth, people get a dental implant. And there are many, many benefits to having a dental implant. Asides, the cosmetic benefits of a dental implant, you get to smile more graciously. For aesthetic purpose. Dental implants add color to peopleâs face.
2270	Some parts of the device can get damaged if they get wet. You need to take off the speech processor before you bathe, shower, or swim. You also can cover that part with a waterproof case or choose a waterproof cochlear implant processor.
2271	Reference Range. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests are used to determine which specific antibiotics a particular bacteria or fungus is sensitive to. Most often, this testing complements a Gram stain and culture, the results of which are obtained much sooner. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests can guide the physician in drug choice and dosage for difficult-to-treat infections.
2272	A culture that is reported as no growth in 24 or 48 hours usually indicates that there is no infection. If the symptoms persist, however, a urine culture may be repeated on another sample to look for the presence of bacteria at lower colony counts or other microorganisms that may cause these symptoms.
2273	Culture and sensitivity, commonly abbreviated as C&S, is a laboratory test used to determine the presence and type of bacteria in an infection and determine the antibiotics most likely to be effective in killing the bacteria in the dog or other animal.
2274	No. You have to take the specimen, take it to the lab, and in the lab they culture it, isolate it and tell you what the identity is based on a gram stain, morphology, biochemical profile (whether it produces oxygen or what) and so forth. Hereâs an actual clinical report with discussion below it.
2275	The urine culture is used to diagnose a urinary tract infection (UTI) and to identify the bacteria or yeast causing the infection. It may be done in conjunction with susceptibility testing to determine which antibiotics will inhibit the growth of the microbe causing the infection.
2276	The sample submitted for culture can be urine, blood, body fluids, pus, discharge or tissue. The sensitivity test follows the culture. Once the bacteria have been grown and isolated in a culture medium, they are tested against different antibiotics to determine which drug(s) is likely to be effective.
2277	Culture and Sensitivity â âC & Sâ. Culture: You send a specimen to the lab and the labs job is to tell you what the organism is, a definitive ID based on gram stain, morphology and biochemical profile. Susceptibility: The lab also gives you the info on the antibiotic susceptibilities to know how to treat it.
2278	Back to TopAlternative Names. Antibiotic sensitivity testing; Antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Back to TopHow the Test Is Performed. After the culture (sample) is collected from a person, it is sent to a lab. There, the samples are put in special containers to grow the microorganisms (germs) from the collected samples.
2279	Results of a urine culture are often interpreted in conjunction with the results of a urinalysis and with regard to how the sample was collected and whether symptoms are present.
2280	Antibiotic sensitivity testing; Antimicrobial susceptibility testing. After the culture (sample) is collected from a person, it is sent to a lab. There, the samples are put in special containers to grow the microorganisms (germs) from the collected samples. Colonies of microorganisms are combined with different antibiotics to see how well each antibiotic stops each colony from growing.

2291	Pseudomonas infection is caused by strains of bacteria found widely in the environment; the most common type causing infections in humans is called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For more images of this bacterium, search the Public Health Image Library.
2292	Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infectious diseases, and nearly 10% of people will experience a UTI during their lifetime.
2293	Bacteria, singular bacterium, Streptococcus pyogenesÂ© S. LowryâUniversity of UlsterâStone/Getty Imagesany of a group of microscopic single-celled organisms that live in enormous numbers in almost every environment on Earth, from deep-sea vents to deep below Earthâs surface to the digestive tracts of humans.
2294	Members of these two prokaryotic domains are as different from one another as they are from eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells (i.e., Bacteria and Archaea) are fundamentally different from the eukaryotic cells that constitute other forms of life. Prokaryotic cells are defined by a much simpler design than is found in eukaryotic cells.
2295	cell: typical cellsEncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc.All living organisms on Earth are made up of one of two basic types of cells: eukaryotic cells, in which the genetic material is enclosed within a nuclear membrane, or prokaryotic cells, in which the genetic material is not separated from the rest of the cell.
2296	Substantial portions of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) copy of the genetic information (deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) are discarded, and the remaining messenger RNA (mRNA) is substantially modified before it is translated into protein.
2297	What types of infections does Pseudomonas aeruginosa cause? Serious Pseudomonas infections usually occur in people in the hospital and/or with weakened immune systems. Infections of the blood, pneumonia, and infections following surgery can lead to severe illness and death in these people. However, healthy people can also develop mild illnesses with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, especially after exposure to water.
2298	A specimen was considered positive for UTI if a single organism was cultured at a concentration of â¥105 cfu/ml, or when a single organism was cultured at a concentration of 104 cfu/ml and â¥5 leukocytes per high-power field were observed on microscopic examination of the urine.
2299	The results show that the antimicrobial resistance patterns of the causes of UTI are highly variable and continuous surveillance of trends in resistance patterns of uropathogens is important.
2300	An accurate and prompt diagnosis of UTI is important in shortening the disease course and for preventing the ascent of the infection to the upper urinary tract and renal failure. 6. Treatment of UTI cases is often started empirically.

2304	Most of the time, though, LDAP is used to search for information in the directory. The LDAP search operation allows some portion of the directory to be searched for entries that match some criteria specified by a search filter.
2305	Global services are usually distributed, meaning that the data they contain is spread across many machines, all of which cooperate to provide the directory service. Typically a global service defines a uniform namespace which gives the same view of the data no matter where you are in relation to the data itself.

2309	OpenLDAP is a widely used LDAP server in Linux environments. It can do a lot of things for all sorts of needs. Whilst Samba, running in 'classic' mode, can use it as a storage backend for accounts and mappings from Windows (TM) SIDs to unix UID/GID, it cannot be used if Samba is running as an AD DC. OpenLDAP can also be used to control mail delivery and other things.

2311	In a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers found that the brains of autistic children showed differences in certain regions that normally develop in the second trimester of pregnancy.
2312	After that, your appetite should return, and will probably grow. Although food is looking much more appetizing, be aware of how much you're eating. You only need about an extra 300 to 500 calories a day during the second trimester, and you should be gaining about 1/2 to 1 pound a week.
2313	Pregnancy is typically broken into three periods, or trimesters, each of about three months. Each trimester is defined as 14 weeks, for a total duration of 42 weeks, although the average duration of pregnancy is 40 weeks.
2314	The second trimester is, for many women, the easiest three months of pregnancy. Take the time now, while you're feeling better and your energy is up, to start planning for your baby's arrival. During the second trimester, your baby is growing quickly. Between your 18th and 22nd week of pregnancy you'll have an ultrasound so your doctor can see how your baby is progressing. You also can learn the sex of your baby, unless you'd rather be surprised.
2315	Still, the trimesters of pregnancy can be a very useful âshorthandâ of sorts that we can use to talk about the symptoms and the progress of pregnancy. The first trimester starts with conception, and concludes roughly 13 or 14 weeks later. The second trimester begins when the first trimester of pregnancy ends. The second trimester of pregnancy begins at around 14 weeks of pregnancy. The second trimester will last for another 13 or 14 weeks, at which point the third trimester will begin. So, the second trimester encompasses the middle part of your pregnancy, and will lst from around the third month to around the sixth month of pregnancy.
2316	Around the middle of the second trimester, movement of the fetus may be felt. At 28 weeks, more than 90% of babies can survive outside of the uterus if provided high-quality medical care. The third trimester is from 29 weeks through 40 weeks. Prenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes.
2317	Working with autopsy brains of 11 children with autism and 11 children without the disorder who were between the ages of two and 15 years, the scientists focused on 25 genes responsible for specific nerve cell types in the outer layer for the brain, whatâs known as the cortex.
2318	The fertilized egg then travels down the fallopian tube and attaches to the inside of the uterus, where it begins to form the fetus and placenta. The first trimester carries the highest risk of miscarriage (natural death of embryo or fetus). The second trimester is from week 13 through 28.
2319	Therefore, during a second pregnancy a woman would be described as gravida 2, para 1 and upon live delivery as gravida 2, para 2. In-progress pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages and/ or stillbirths account for parity values being less than the gravida number.
2320	A new report shows the brains of autistic children, who suffer from the disorder tied to a combination of contributing factors from genes to the environment, have differences in regions that develop during the mother's second trimester of pregnancy.
2321	Plant cells have several structures not found in other eukaryotes. In particular, organelles called chloroplasts allow plants to capture the energy of the Sun in energy-rich molecules; cell walls allow plants to have rigid structures as varied as wood trunks and supple leaves; and vacuoles allow plant cells to change size.
2322	Plant cells have high concentrations of molecules dissolved in their cytoplasm, which causes water to come into the cell under normal conditions and makes the cell's central vacuole swell and press against the cell wall. With a healthy supply of water, turgor pressure keeps a plant from wilting.
2323	Plant cells have certain distinguishing features, including chloroplasts, cell walls, and intracellular vacuoles. Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts; cell walls allow plants to have strong, upright structures; and vacuoles help regulate how cells handle water and storage of other molecules.
2324	The biological membranes provide much of the functionality of the organisms of which they are a part. From intracellular organelles to extracellular cellâcell interactions, membranes provide the structures necessary for biological function and organisation. Many structural and functional features are common among membranes in archaea, bacteria, eukaryotic cells and enveloped viruses. The fundamental architecture of all biological membranes is built upon the lipid bilayer. Thus, all membranes have properties in common. Membrane proteins confer a myriad of specific functions expressed by cell membranes. Plasma membranes determine the cell boundary and the interactions of the cell with its environment. Intracellular membranes compartmentalise cells into different functional units with differing internal compositions.
2325	The cell wall surrounds the plasma membrane of plant cells and provides tensile strength and protection against mechanical and osmotic stress. It also allows cells to develop turgor pressure, which is the pressure of the cell contents against the cell wall.
2326	The Clydesdale is a draft horse breed from Lanarkshire, Scotland, and its name was inspired by the River Clyde. The Clydesdaleâs history goes back to the mid-1700s, when native stocks were mated with larger Flemish horses and then selected for use in agriculture and for all types of heavy hauling, including transport through the streets of Glasgow.

2328	Characteristics and Origin of the Clydesdale Horse. The Clydesdale is a breed of heavy draft horse developed in and deriving its name from the district in Scotland where it was founded. Its type was evolved by the farmers of Lanarkshire, through which the River Clyde flows. The old name for Lanarkshire is Clydesdale.
2329	Clydesdale horses were first exhibited under the breed name in 1826, and the breed was further standardized through the system of hiring out purebred stallions. The Clydesdale Horse Society was formed in 1877, and its breed registry records go back to the 1830s. The Clydesdale was first imported to North America in the 1840s. The breedâs attractiveness and size led to its use in promotional hitches, such as one sponsored by the Chicago Stockyard Company.

2358	Malting is the process of converting barley or other cereal grains into malt, for use in brewing, distilling, or in foods and takes place in a maltings, sometimes called a malthouse, or a malting floor.The cereal is spread out on the malting floor in a layer of 8 to 12 cm (3 to 5 inch) depth.alting is the process of converting barley or other cereal grains into malt, for use in brewing, distilling, or in foods and takes place in a maltings, sometimes called a malthouse, or a malting floor.

2360	Brewing is the production of beer by steeping a starch source (commonly cereal grains) in water and fermenting the resulting sweet liquid with yeast.hen the fermentation is complete the brewer may rack the beer into a new tank, called a conditioning tank. Conditioning of the beer is the process in which the beer ages, the flavour becomes smoother, and flavours that are unwanted dissipate.
2361	The basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as malted barley, able to be fermented (converted into alcohol); a brewer's yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring, such as hops, to offset the sweetness of the malt.hen the fermentation is complete the brewer may rack the beer into a new tank, called a conditioning tank. Conditioning of the beer is the process in which the beer ages, the flavour becomes smoother, and flavours that are unwanted dissipate.
2362	Malt can be further processed to produce liquid or dried sweeteners called Malt Extracts. There are several classes of Malt Extracts, including Standard Malt Extracts, Specialty and Black Malt Extracts, and Coextracts of Malt and Other Cereal Grains.Other unmalted grains or starch sources can be converted into extracts, using malted barley as a natural enzyme source in the extraction process. this is done most often for economy and, in some cases, to make a lighter flavored syrup.owever, similar to the term malt, the term malt extract unqualified refers to an extract of malted barley. According to CFR, an extract of 100% malted barley can also be referred to as malt syrup.
2363	Most beer is fermented with a brewer's yeast and flavoured with hops. Secondary starch sources (adjuncts), such as maize (corn), rice, or sugar, may also be used. Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and cassava.The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill.hen the fermentation is complete the brewer may rack the beer into a new tank, called a conditioning tank. Conditioning of the beer is the process in which the beer ages, the flavour becomes smoother, and flavours that are unwanted dissipate.

2374	The. , a stele bearing the most complete and perfect extant collection of Babylonian laws developed during the reign of Hammurabi (1792-1750 BCE), was discovered near the castle in 1901 by French Orientalist Jean-Vincent Scheil.
2375	Hammurabi. (haemoÍorae`hÃ¤moÍorÃ¤) , bÄ. flâ1792 1750.B., c king Of Babylonia, babylonia ancient empire Of. Mesopotamia the name is sometimes given to the whole civilization Of S, mesopotamia including the states established by the city rulers Of, Lagash (akkad Or), Agade, uruk And ur in the 3d Millennium.B...... c
2376	Hammurabiâs edicts were a fixture of the ancient world, but the laws were later lost to history and werenât rediscovered until 1901, when a team of French archeologists unearthed the famous diorite stele at the ancient city of Susa, Iran, once the seat of the Elamite Empire.
2377	These famous pre-Biblical laws helped shape Babylonian life in Hammurabiâs time, but their influence would echo throughout the ancient world for over a millennia. Below, find out more about the fascinating history behind one of antiquityâs most important legal codes.
2378	Itâs not the earliest known code of laws. Hammurabiâs dictates are often cited as the oldest written laws on record, but they were predated by at least two other ancient codes of conduct from the Middle East.
2379	The Code includes one of the earliest examples of the presumption of innocence. While itâs notorious for its catalogue of barbaric punishments, Hammurabiâs Code also set several valuable legal precedents that have survived to this day.
2380	In the 18th century B.C., the Babylonian King Hammurabi fashioned a compendium of 282 laws that set standards of conduct and justice for his empire in ancient Mesopotamia.
2381	Although the Code of Hammurabi was essentially humanitarian in its intent and orientation, it contained the eye for an eye theory of punishment, which is a barbarian application of the concept of making the punishment fit the crime.
2382	King of Babylonia (1792â1750. ). The ascendancy of Babylonia is associated with his name. An Amorite in origin, Hammurabi was a skillful politician and military leader.
2383	The Code of Hammurabi was a comprehensive set of laws, considered by many scholars to be the oldest laws established; they were handed down four thousand years ago by King Hammurabi of Babylon.
2384	Combination Drugs. Over-the-counter medications designed to treat multiple symptoms often contain painkillers in combination with other drugs. Cold and flu medications often contain painkillers as well as decongestants. And menstrual pain relievers often provide diuretics, too. I am not a big fan of combination drugs, Schmitz said.
2385	Choosing a painkiller off the drug store shelf can be, well, painful. To offer some relief, Consumer Reports Health released its Best Buy Drugs -- a 22-page report that compares the effectiveness, safety and price of some of the top brands (and generics) for pain killing.
2386	And if you use aspirin along with ibuprofen or naproxen, the risk to your stomach is even greater. Any of these pain drugs alone can cause ulcers, and using them together only increases the risk, says Glaser. All three of these medications reduce pain through their effects on the prostaglandin pathways..
2387	Another NSAID, ibuprofen, has pain relieving effects similar to those of acetylsalicylic acid. But it tends to work better even at a lower dose and have milder side effects. It is a very good anti-inflammatory medication, originally developed to treat arthritis, said Duke's Collins.
2388	This may also lead to localized muscle spasm and pain referred to other areas away from the injection site. Sometimes the original pain may return or occasionally get worse after a treatment. Notify the office only if your pain medication, anti-inflammatories, ice and/or heat are ineffective. MEDICATION POLICY: If appropriate, controlled medications (narcotics, relaxants, and sedatives) may be prescribed prior to discharge from your procedure. Prescribing controlled medications over the phone is avoided.
2389	In most cases and when taken properly for pain, these drugs are very safe. That's why they're sold over-the-counter in the first place. But there are some situations where you can put yourself at risk by using these pain drugs improperly. Acetaminophen and Risk of Liver Damage. One of the most well-known risks of painkillers is liver damage from acetaminophen. Although [acetaminophen] has been used for years and overall is extremely safe, liver toxicity can occur with use of more than 4,000 milligrams in a day, says Dr. Glaser.
2390	Clear liquids are allowed up to 3 hours before your appointment. (i.e. apple juice, water, coffee/tea without milk/cream).â¢ See attached blood thinner list for medications that need to be stopped prior to procedure.â¢ You must notify the physician prescribing the blood thinner before stopping them.
2391	Always have assistance when walking up stairs, you may have numbness or weakness in the extremity related to the procedure, which could cause it to give out.DIET: Advance from clear liquids to your regular diet as tolerated.WOUND: Band-aids may be removed after 24 hours and do not need to be replaced.
2392	The report focuses on non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), which commonly are used to treat pain associated with arthritis. But NSAIDs are only one type of painkiller. Depending on the ache, another type might be better. And depending on the sufferer, some drugs can be dangerous.
2393	In patients on blood thinners such as Coumadin or Plavix to prevent clots, these medications [NSAIDS and aspirin] can lead to the unintentional over-thinning of the blood and excessive risks of bleeding, Glaser says. Additionally, these NSAIDs have been shown to raise blood pressure.

2414	With a staple down or nail down installation over a wood subfloor using solid flooring or engineered flooring, it is recommended that an underlayment of 15lb. black felt paper is rolled out over the wood subfloor prior to installing the new floor.
2415	Your choice in underlay performs a few unglamorous, yet extremely important, functions after youâve laid down your solid hardwood floor, bamboo floors, engineered wood flooring, or laminate floor. Here are the 5 reasons you need underlay for your wood floor installation. Underlay evens out minor subfloor imperfections. An even subfloor is a key element to greater stability when it comes to your choice in wood flooring.
2416	1 And a big part of that is a warm floor. A good underlay keeps the damp cold away from the floor board, and the resulting cold away from your feet.  Underlay aids in moisture resistance. This benefit is particularly true when you invest in an underlay with an attached vapor barrier.
2417	In other words, laminate flooring is a floating floor. If the glue, adhesive, or thin set are used to attach the floor product to the sub floor, the underlayment serves different purposes when used under a laminate floor. 1. Padding or underlayment serves as noise reduction.
2418	Hardwood, laminate, bamboo and vinyl flooring underlayment products help dampen sound, protect your floor from harmful moisture and provide thermal insulation.
2419	1 And a big part of that is a warm floor. A good underlay keeps the damp cold away from the floor board, and the resulting cold away from your feet. And speaking of damp  â¦. Underlay aids in moisture resistance.
2420	Underlayments play an important role during the installation of new hardwood flooring or laminate flooring. Whether you intend to staple down, nail down or float, an underlayment offers a slew of benefits during and after installation.
2421	1 And stability, as you know, is what youâre after if you want your floor to last.  Underlay helps to reduce noise. One of the issues with laminate flooring, and other floating floors, is the noise of footfalls. This has improved as flooring products have evolved, of course.
2422	We've found that the most popular are the 1/8 IN. thick cork underlayment (3mm) and the 1/4 IN. thick cork underlayment (6mm). The only difference is the thickness, the thicker 6 mm will give you twice the sound absorption if desired to lessen any noise when the floor is walked on.
2423	Laminate Flooring with Underlayment Attached. Some manufacturers, like QuickStep and Alloc, make laminate flooring with an underlayment already attached to the back of each board. This makes installation quick and simple, negating the need to roll out a separate underlayment.
2424	Light-Blue top tube. Additive: anticoagulant sodium citrate (prevents coagulation by binding to calcium in the specimen). Fill tubes completely to maintain the ratio of 9 parts blood to 1 part sodium citrate. Invert tubes 3 - 4 times.

To prevent injury and exposure to potentially infectious material, do not ship frozen serum, plasma, or whole blood received in glass tubes or SST (glass or plastic).
2433	Deciding to use a butterfly and short draw evacuated tubes on the tiny cephalic vein on the dorsal side of the right arm, the phlebotomist collects the light blue tube first and the lavender last.
2434	One of the biggest ones is in Scotland, reaching 177 ft. Measurement of Giant Sequoia Redwood tree sizes are based on height, girth at the ground and the volume. The tree called General Sherman has the biggest volume at 52,508 cubic ft. The tallest reaches a height of 311 ft (unnamed). The oldest are 3,500 years old and found in the Converse basin.
2435	When speaking of Redwood tree sizes, one should distinguish between the two types. The Coast Redwood trees (Sequoia sempervirens) are the tallest on Earth (the highest reaches up to 379 ft). The Giant Sequoia or Sierra Redwood trees (Sequoiadendron giganeum) reach 290 ft (average) and have the biggest volume.
2436	The tallest tree is Hyperion (in Redwood National Park) at 379.1 ft. Currently there are over 30 trees over 360 ft tall. There are over 150 trees over 350 ft tall. There are unconfirmed reports of a 380 ft tree that was chopped down in 1912. The biggest Redwood tree size possible is 425 ft. In terms of volume, the biggest is the Lost Monarch.
2437	Its 40/20/40 split-fold design lets second-row passengers slide their seat to match their own idea of leg room. Page 6 No matter what youâve got planned, Sequoia is happy to oblige. Both the sliding second-row and third-row seats fold flat, making it easy to load and unload all the gear your road trip requires.
2438	1 The Hazelwood Tree (not listed above) had a volume of 36,228 cubic feet (1,025.9 m 3) before losing half its trunk in a lightning storm in 2002, if it were still at full size it would currently be the 17th largest giant sequoia on earth.
2439	Because most of the neighboring trees are also quite large, it can be difficult to appreciate the size of an individual giant sequoia. The largest giant sequoias are as tall as a 26-story building, and the width of their bases can exceed that of a city street. They grow at such a rate as to produce roughly 40 cubic feet (1.1 m 3) of wood each year, approximately equal to the volume of a 50-foot-tall tree one foot in diameter.
2440	There's 19.8 cubic feet of space behind the third row seats, and the independent suspension allows that third row to fold flat into floor to free up 66.6 cubic feet. Fold the second row too, and there's a full 120.1 cubes to play with. The Sequoia's two-tone dashboard is shared with Tundra. The controls are user-friendly for the most apart, although the sheer width of the SUV can make the audio controls difficult to reach for shorter drivers.
2441	However, with a height of 286 feet (87 m) or more, a circumference of 113 feet (34 m) or more, an estimated bole volume of up to 52,500 cubic feet (1,487 m 3), and an estimated age of 1800â2700 years, the giant sequoia is among the tallest, widest and longest-lived of all organisms on Earth.
2442	Meet the commanding 2016 Toyota Sequoia, the SUV built to inspire your kidsâ most-liked status updates. Sequoia provides seating for up to eight, 1 along with the cargo room you want for everyoneâs gear. Inside, its host of high-tech features gives your family the ultimate in convenience and comfort.
2443	Make no mistake: the Toyota Sequoia isn't some dainty crossover. It's a truck-based full-size SUV with ample room for eight passengers and loads of towing and hauling ability. While its one of the more refined examples of a dying breed, the Sequoia is still a thirsty rig that's a bit more cumbersome to drive than its car-derived competitors.
2444	All Latex. This literally means the whole mattress from top to bottom and edge to edge is made of latex, whether it be 100% natural, blended or synthetic, dunlop or talalay; there could be one or more layers, but the trait is that there are no other layers (apart from the flame retardant cover).
2445	Talalay latex is more supple and resilient. All latex is meaured in ILD (indention load deflection) and a 32 ILD in Dunlop is not firmer than a 32 ILD in Talalay, although it is stiffer. We used to carry Dunlop in Natural before we were able to get the Talalay Natural.
2446	First, we made the worldâs most luxurious all-natural latex mattress. Then we made it affordable. You can pay $4,000 or more for a top-of-the-line latex mattress at a retail store, but it wonât match Zenhaven. Handcrafted in America of 100% natural American Talalay latex, layered with breathable 100% organic New Zealand wool and wrapped in lush organic cotton, Zenhaven takes you to new heights of comfort and health.
2447	Talalay process latex was developed in the early 70âs and was pioneered by the new startup company Latex International. It really helped bring back latex to the forefront as a raw material used in mattresses. Essentially the Talalay process uses extreme heat and extreme cold during the vulcanization to produce very good cell structure.
2448	Latex in general and Talalay latex in particular is very resilient, which is the exact opposite of visco elastic slow recovery foam. Visco elastic foam has been much ballyhooed as being the most pressure relieving surface foam for mattresses.
2449	Pure Talalay Bliss uses Oeko-Tex certified Talalay Latex and fabrics in all of our mattresses. This certification verifies our products do not contain harmful substances or pose a health risk to consumers and is even safe for babies. All of our Talalay Latex is manufactured by Talalay Global in Shelton, CT, USA.
2450	Our 100% Natual Latex is made by Radium with the Talalay process. We have found the Radium Natural Talalay to be the purest and most consistant Natural Latex. Our FloBeds Natural Latex is produced using no fillers or shortcuts. It is made from 100% Latex Rubber from the Rubber Tree. Talalay Latex provides the most supple, body conforming and long lasting mattresses.
2451	Both Talalay Latex and Memory Foam are marketed as the premium mattress materials, but they are very different. 1  Talalay Latex is a rubber. Memory Foam is a foam, which doesn't provide both support and pressure relief. 2  Talalay Latex rubber is a natural material derived from the rubber tree.
2452	Because dunlop is denser it is firmer and widely used as a base platform (like in the LUCID 16â³ reviewed below), whereas talalay latex is good for a more soft or plush finish so makes a great top layer (like in the DreamFoam Ultimate Dreams 10â³ reviewed below).

The same card graded by PSA in near/Mint-Mint conditioâ¦n could sell between $15,000. AND $40.000. A good way of finding the value of collectible items is to see what they are selling for at auction.
2556	Joe DiMaggio joined the Yankees for the 1936 season, making his major league debut on May 3 against the St. Louis Browns. He played with a talented team which included members Lou Gehrig, Tony Lazzeri, Red Ruffing and Lefty Gomez. It had been two years since Babe Ruth left the Yankees, and the team was in need of a new era of success.

2559	What position did Joe DiMaggio play?   Center Field   The first year Joe DiMaggio played he moved around the outfield, but after that he was basically the Yankees center fielder until he retired. In 1950â¦ he played one game at first base, with 13 putouts.
2560	Joe DiMaggio. Joseph Paul Joe DiMaggio (November 25, 1914 â March 8, 1999), nicknamed Joltin' Joe and The Yankee Clipper, was an American Major League Baseball center fielder who played his entire 13-year career for the New York Yankees. He is perhaps best known for his 56-game hitting streak (May 15 â July 16, 1941), a record that still stands.
2561	48 - Joe DiMaggio made his debut on May 3, 1936, and went three-for-six at the plate. By the end of the month (Game by Game Batting Logs), Joe had 48 hits (the most by a rookie during their first month), was batting .381, and only went hitless in two games.

2574	However, lead is not the only divalent (2) transition metal ion available to combine with MoO4 ions, It is trace amounts of vanadium, manganese, chromium, and titanium that depart the wonderful yellow, orange, and red colors. These elements do this by absorbing the violet, blue and green visible spectra.
2575	As an oxidation zone mineral, wulfenite is often associated with other metals and their oxidation products. Cerussite (PbCO3), vanadinite (Pb5(VO4)3Cl), and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl) are natural associations given the presence of lead in the mineral formula.
2576	Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history, but the element was discovered (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm.
2577	Molybdenum is a chemical element with symbol Mo and atomic number 42. The name is from Neo-Latin molybdaenum, from Ancient Greek Î¼ÏÎ»ÏÎ²Î´Î¿Ï molybdos, meaning lead, since its ores were confused with lead ores.
2578	Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth; it is found only in various oxidation states in minerals. The free element, a silvery metal with a gray cast, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element.
2579	In addition to coloring elements, other impurities or factors exist that have also been linked to the color of minerals. Such things as elemental fluorine, sulfur, and chlorine; trace amounts of carbonate and other ion groups; chlorine and fluorine ions and even structural defects.
2580	With a density of 6.5-7.0 (quartz is 2.65, calcite is 2.71), wulfenite is among the densest of all transparent minerals. However, because most of the elemental bonding in wulfenite is due to weak ionic bonds, wulfenite is soft, registering just 2.5-3.0 on the Mohs scale, or slightly softer than calcite.

2582	They can cause a mineral to always be a certain color if they are part of the chemistry of the mineral. However, if there is just a trace of these elements, they still can strongly influence the color of the mineral. Even tiny amounts of these elements can deeply colored minerals. It is erroneously thought that certain elements cause only certain colors and there is some truth to that.

2735	Leukocytosis is defined as an elevation of the WBC count for the patient's age. Using an appropriate reference interval is critical, because a WBC count of 30 Ã 109/L is considered elevated in an adult, but completely normal in the first few days of life.
2736	Morphologic approach. Microcytic anemia â MCV < 80 fl. Reduced iron availability âsevere iron deficiency, the. anemia of chronic disease, copper deficiency. Reduced heme synthesis âlead poisoning, congenital or. acquired sideroblastic anemia. Reduced globinproduction âthalassemicstates, other. hemoglobinopathies.
2737	The PB smear review is a qualitative examination of the blood smear to detect clinically significant abnormalities in all cells, including leukocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets. A slide review is appropriate in all patients with unexplained leukocytosis, which requires proper slide preparation and staining.
2738	The percentage of smudge cells in peripheral blood smears of patients with the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [26% (range, 4%-86%)] was higher than in patients with B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders [14% (range, 1%-64%)] (p=0.0005) (Figure 1). We then analyzed the discriminating capacity of the five different cut-offs.
2739	Patients with less than 30% smudge cells had a median. time from diagnosis to initial treatment of 72.7 months, whereas. the median time from diagnosis to initial treatment in patients. with 30% or more smudge cells was not reached (P=.001). The. percentage of smudge cells as a continuous variable correlated.
2740	Smudge cells are. CLL cells ruptured during smear preparation. We hypothesized. that smudge cell formation is inversely correlated with expression. of vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein and prognostic marker, and. that the percentage of smudge cells would predict prognosis in.
2741	Anemia of Chronic Disease. Common in patients with infection, cancer, inflammatory and rheumatologic diseases. Iron can not be remobilized from storage. Blunted production of erythropoietin and. response to erythropoietin. Usually normocytic and normochromic but may. be microcytic if severe.
2742	We investigated whether the percentage of smudge cells in peripheral blood smears can be used in the clinical practice to differentiate CLL from other B-cell CLD. The peripheral blood smears of 63 patients with the diagnosis of CLL and 62 with other B-cell CLD were analyzed.
2743	Approach to anemia. Definition (The WHO criteria): Men: Hb <13.0 g/dL or Ht<40%. Women: Hb <12.0 g/dL or Ht<36%. Useful measurements: Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): 80 to 100 fl. RDW (red cell distribution width): increased. RDW indicates the presence of cells of widely.

2805	To treat superficial (minor) burns at home, follow the advice below. 1  Cool the skin with running cool or tepid water for at least 10 minutes, ideally within 20 minutes of the injury happening.  Do not use ice, iced water, creams, or greasy substances (such as butter) to soothe the burn.
2806	Why do scars form? Scarring is related to age, ethnic origin, and the severity, depth and location of the burn. Scars form when the dermal or lower layer of the skin has been damaged, as in the case of a burn. The body forms a protein called collagen to help heal the damaged skin.
2807	Burns can damage or destroy the oil glands that normally keep skin from getting too dry. Partial thickness burns have few oil glands and full thickness burns or skin grafts have no oil glands. The lack of oil glands leads to dry itchy scars. Many patients experience intense itching after their burn.

2834	An erosional floodplain is created as a stream cuts deeper into its channel and laterally into its banks. A stream with a steep gradient will tend to downcut faster than it causes lateral erosion, resulting in a deep, narrow channel with little or no floodplain at all.
2835	Floodplain management is a continuous process of making decisions about whether and how floodplain lands and waters are to be used.
2836	The purpose of this page is to define flood zones, a commonly used term in floodplain management. Definition/Description Flood hazard areas identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map are identified as a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). SFHA are defined as the area that will be inundated by the flood event having a 1-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. The 1-percent annual chance flood is also referred to as the base flood or 100-year flood.
2837	What is Floodplain Management Floodplain management is the operation of a community program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing flood damage. These measures take a variety of forms and generally include zoning, subdivision, or building requirements, and special-purpose floodplain ordinances.
2838	The purpose of this page is to define Zone A, a commonly used term in floodplain management.Definition/DescriptionAreas subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event generally determined using approximate methodologies.
2839	A floodplain, or flood plain, is flat or nearly flat land adjacent to a stream or river that experiences occasional flooding. It includes the floodway, which consists of the stream channel and adjacent areas that carry flood flows, and the flood fringe, which are areas covered by the flood, but which do not experience a strong current. Floodplains are formed in two ways: by erosion; and by aggradation.
2840	Moderate flood hazard areas, labeled Zone B or Zone X (shaded) are also shown on the FIRM, and are the areas between the limits of the base flood and the 0.2-percent-annual-chance (or 500-year) flood.
2841	For regulatory purposes, the floodplain is divided into two areas based on water velocity: the floodway & the flood fringe. The floodway includes the channel & the portion of the adjacent floodplain required to pass the 100-year flood without increasing flood heights.

2854	For most of the area's history the land that surrounds the Clear Fork has been used as range and crop land. In 1956 the fork was dammed seven miles east of Weatherford to form Weatherford Lake. In 1949 it was dammed in Tarrant County to form Lake Benbrook, ten miles southwest of Fort Worth. Like Lake Weatherford, Lake Benbrook was constructed in part to control the seasonal flooding of the Clear Fork.

2855	From the junction of the East and West Forks the Trinity River continues southeast, forming all or part of the county lines between Kaufman and Ellis, Ellis and Henderson, Henderson and Navarro, Freestone and Anderson, Anderson and Leon, Leon and Houston, and Houston and Madison counties.
2856	The East Fork of the Trinity River rises in central Grayson County and flows south seventy-eight miles, through central Collin, western Rockwall, eastern Dallas, and western Kaufman counties, to the southwestern part of Kaufman County, where it joins the West Fork.
2857	It flows south-southwest along the west side of the Trinity Mountains into Trinity Lake (20 miles (32 km) long) formed on the river by the Trinity Dam, then immediately into the smaller Lewiston Lake, formed by the Lewiston Dam at Lewiston.
2858	The Elm Fork of the Trinity rises in eastern Montague County and flows southeast eighty-five miles, through Cooke and Denton counties, to a confluence with the West Fork, which forms the Trinity River proper a mile west of downtown Dallas in central Dallas County (at 32Â°48' N, 96Â°52' W).
2859	The original Hupa name for the Trinity River was the Hoopah River. It was also known as the Indian Scalp River when first crossed by the Jedediah Smith fur-trapper's party heading northwards up the coast on May 25, 1828. The Trinity River flooded massively in the Great Flood of 1862, wiping out the economy of the area.
2860	The Trinity River is the longest tributary of the Klamath River, approximately 165 miles (266 km) long, in northwestern California in the United States. It drains an area of the Coast Ranges, including the southern Klamath Mountains, northwest of the Sacramento Valley.

2875	Hence, if a continuous data falls in the range 0 to 5, the data points can take any real number value in between 0 and 5. For example, if we measure the height of the students in a class, then the data points can take any real number value within the range of height of humans.
2876	Analysis of data obtained from discrete variables requires the use of specific statistical tests which are different from those used to assess continuous variables (such as cardiac output, blood pressure, or PaO 2) which can assume an infinite range of values.
2877	The possible number of correct answers a student can get is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: only 6 possibilities, and this is a finite number. Therefore, if we collect data of the number of questions correctly answered by a student, then that particular data will be discrete. In a game, one has to shoot a target.
2878	The critical value of chi-square for a significance level (or p-value) of 0.05, for example, is 3.84. The null hypothesis for the chi-square test is that there is no difference in test results between patients with and without the disease.
2879	Using Discrete Random Variables. When given a discrete random variable, Z, you can establish the probability of each outcome with a probability function. For example, if you flip a coin and z1=heads and z2=tails, the probability function is as follows: f(z)= {1/2 for Z=z1, 1/2 for Z=z2.
2880	In statistics, a random variable is a function of a probability space. In practical terms, a random variable is the result of an experiment. Random variables can either be discrete or continuous. When using a random variable in calculations, it is important to determine whether it is discrete or continuous, as this affects the mathematical outcomes.

2904	A quick and easy way to check is to try putting a small magnet on the piece. If the magnet falls, your piece is solid brass and you should read on! But if the magnet sticks, your piece is brass plated steel and what youâre seeing is not tarnish but rust. Take some very fine grade steel wool and buff away the rust.
2905	Why doesn't stainless steel rust? Stainless steel remains stainless, or does not rust, because of the interaction between its alloying elements and the environment. Stainless steel contains iron, chromium, manganese, silicon, carbon and, in many cases, significant amounts of nickel and molybdenum.
2906	Titanium is as strong as steel, but as light as aluminum. It does not corrode, does not tarnish, and in its pure state, is totally non-allergenic. It does not react to sunlight, salt-water, or any body chemistry. It can be anodized to be a rainbow of colors. Grades 1-4 of Titanium are pure titanium. Lower grades (higher numbers) are alloys with other metals.
2907	Does Aluminum Rust? Aluminum corrodes but it does not rust. Rust refers only to iron and steel corrosion. Aluminum is actually very prone to corrosion. However, aluminum corrosion is aluminum oxide, a very hard material that actually protects the aluminum from further corrosion. Aluminum oxide corrosion also looks a lot more like aluminum (dull gray to powdery white in color), so it isn't as easy to notice as rusted iron.
2908	Rust is usually used to refer to a very common, reddish-brown compound called iron oxide (Fe2O3). Iron oxide is formed when iron and oxygen react in the presence of water or moisture in the air. Iron oxide is very common, because iron reacts easily with oxygen in the air. In fact, it reacts so readily with oxygen that it's actually very rare to find pure iron in nature. Rust can also refer to the reaction of iron and chloride in an underwater environment.
2909	Though it does not rust, exposed bronze is subject to oxidation. Copper is the major component of bronze, and it passes through several stages of oxidation in the presence of oxygen and an electrolyte such as rain water.
2910	Iron and steel rust when they come into contact with water and oxygen. They rust faster in salty water or acid rain. Aluminium, on the other hand, does not corrode easily, because its surface is protected by a layer of aluminium oxide. Iron is the metal most commonly associated with rust. Oxidated iron is called hydrated iron oxide, and it has the burnt orange color most commonly associated with rust.
2911	As such, this film, otherwise known as rust, achieves sufficient thickness to make it easily observable soon after exposure to water and air. In summary, stainless steel does not rust because it is sufficiently reactive to protect itself from further attack by forming a passive corrosion product layer.
2912	Brass is an alloy metal made up of zinc and copper. The amounts used of each are adjusted depending on the intended use of the piece. Brass is popular and is used for cookware, mirror frames, picture frames, vases, candlesticks, instruments, jewelry, fittings and so much more. Brass, like silver and other metals, does tarnish easily.
2913	Rust occurs when iron or its alloys, such as steel, corrode. The surface of a piece of iron will begin to corrode first in the presence of oxygen and water. Given enough time, any piece of iron will change entirely into rust and disintegrate. The process of rusting is a combustion reaction, similar to fire.

2924	Overfeeding is the number-one cause of high nitrate levels in aquariums. Overfed fish produce much more waste than normal, and when more food is given than they can take in, the uneaten food rots and produces even more wastes. Overstocking. Keeping too many fish in a tank also leads to problems with accumulated wastes.
2925	Nitrates are less harmful to aquarium fish than nitrite but, in high doses or with prolonged exposure, they can still be dangerous. Nitrate is the third by-product of the nitrogen cycle and the ideal level in a healthy aquarium is below 30 ppm (parts per million).
2926	Most aquarists have some familiarity with nitrite. It is part of the nitrogen cycle that takes place in most aquariums, and so is one of the first encounters that many aquarists have with their aquariums' chemistry.
2927	Overfeeding is the number-one cause of high nitrate levels in aquariums. Overfed fish produce much more waste than normal, and when more food is given than they can take in, the uneaten food rots and produces even more wastes. Keeping too many fish in a tank also leads to problems with accumulated wastes.
2928	The significance of nitrates in the aquarium is arguably less understood by fish keepers than the effect of ammonia and nitrites. Although nitrates are not directly lethal in the way ammonia or nitrites are, over time high levels of nitrate have a negative effect on fish, plants and the aquarium environment in general. Effect on Fish. Fish will feel the impact of nitrates by the time the levels reach 100 ppm, particularly if levels remain there.
2929	On the other hand, if you reduce the level of water in the tank to 20% of normal and then refill the tank to a 40% level, you have already reduced your nitrate levels by... MORE half. If you then refill the tank to the 100% level, your nitrate levels will be 20% of the original level that you started out at.
2930	During an aquarium's initial setup, few of these ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are present. As the ammonia accumulates, bacteria that utilize it increase in population. As that occurs, they consume the initial ammonia spike, and a nitrite spike results.
2931	How to Reduce Nitratesâ. 1  Keep the tank clean â Waste ultimately produces nitrates. Cleaner tanks produce fewer nitrates in the first place. 2  Donât overfeed the fish â Overfeeding is a significant contributor to excess nitrates and other undesirable wastes, such as phosphates.
2932	Although nitrates are not directly lethal in the way ammonia or nitrites are, over time high levels of nitrate have a negative effect on fish, plants and the aquarium in general. Although nitrates are not directly lethal in the way ammonia or nitrites are, over time high levels of nitrate have a negative effect on fish, plants and the aquarium in general.
2933	Lower the nitrite level. 1  You can dilute the nitrite level with a 25% partial water change. If your tank is new, try to leave the biological filter and gravel bed alone so the bacteria are not disturbed and will keep multiplying. 2  Filter out the nitrite directly using API Nitra Zorb filter media in freshwater aquariums.
2934	Depending on your income, you can claim a tax credit for up to 35 percent of your preschool expenses, up to $3,000 for one child or $6,000 for two or more children, applied directly, dollar-for-dollar, to your taxes owed for the year.o claim the child and dependent care credit, you must have earned income for the year you're filing for.

2984	If you earn 6 percent a year annually on a $300,000 retirement nest egg and withdraw 4 percent a year, youâd be left with $506,331 at the end of 30 years. Now, assume a 12 percent return in year one and 0 percent in year two, in a repeating pattern for 30 years.

2986	To figure out how much you will save by the time you retire, we first estimate your future income by growing your current income at a rate of 3.8% (the inflation rate of 2.3%, plus the salary growth rate of 1.5%). Then, we determine what the sum of your annual contributions will be between now and retirement.
2987	In fact, 35 percent of workers between the ages of 45 to 54 have less than $25,000 in retirement savings. And more than six out of 10 have less than $100,000. At the same time, they are paying for big-ticket nonretirement expenses, such as college tuition, which can throw a wrench into growing a considerable nest egg.
2988	The second point in time is the day you retire, when you are about 65 to 66 years old. That period between now and then is an important one. In those (approximately 10 to 15) years, you will have time to put more of your paycheck to work in a retirement account.
2989	So if you earn $100,000 the year you retire, we estimate you will need $85,000 during the first year of retirement. For each subsequent year, we increase your income need by 2.3% to keep up with inflation.

First, we determine what your income will be at the time you retire by growing your current income at an annual rate of 3.8% (the inflation rate of 2.3%, plus the salary growth rate of 1.5%). We then assume you can live comfortably off of 85% of your pre-retirement income.

2996	By Matt Rosenberg. Near the equator, from about 5Â° north and 5Â° south, the northeast trade winds and southeast trade winds converge in a low pressure zone known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone or ITCZ. Solar heating in the region forces air to rise through convection which results in a plethora of precipitation.he location of the ITCZ can vary as much as 40Â° to 45Â° of latitude north or south of the equator based on the pattern of land and ocean. In Africa, the ITCZ is located just south of the Sahel at about 10Â°, dumping rain on the region to the south of the desert.
2997	The Intertropical Convergence Zone has been called the doldrums by sailors due to the lack of horizontal air movement (the air simply rises with convection). The ITCZ is also known as the Equatorial Convergence Zone or Intertropical Front.he location of the ITCZ can vary as much as 40Â° to 45Â° of latitude north or south of the equator based on the pattern of land and ocean. In Africa, the ITCZ is located just south of the Sahel at about 10Â°, dumping rain on the region to the south of the desert.
2998	In the seamen's speech the zone is referred to as the doldrums because of its erratic weather patterns with stagnant calms and violent thunderstorms. The ITCZ appears as a band of clouds, usually thunderstorms, that circle the globe near the equator.In the Northern Hemisphere, the trade winds move in a southwestern direction from the northeast, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they move northwestward from the southeast.s the ITCZ migrates more than 500 kilometres (300 mi) from the equator during the respective hemisphere's summer season, increasing Coriolis force makes the formation of tropical cyclones within this zone more possible.
2999	The Tropical Climate Control. The most important climate control in regard to the tropical climate types relates to the position of the Inter Tropical Convergent Zone or ITCZ. The ITCZ is an area of low pressure and marks the point of trade wind convergence.he second distinctive climate feature of tropical regions is the dry season. As you can see from the diagram to the right of the Hadley circulation air rises above the ITCZ to create a low pressure zone, characterised by high humidity and rainfall. Further north and south of this zone air begins to sink.
3000	Definition. The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, is a belt of low pressure which circles the Earth generally near the equator where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres come together. It is characterised by convective activity which generates often vigorous thunderstorms over large areas.efinition.

It is actually a band a few hundred kilometres wide, enclosing places where winds flow inwards (are 'confluent') and subsequently rise convectively.he movement of the ITCZ across South Africa (Figure 12.1) is complicated by the land's shape, elevation and location, and there is a southerly spur called the Zaire Air Boundary (ZAB). Similarly, there is a spur over South America.

3023	So of the 118 cruise ships delivered since 2000 sixty-seven, or more than half, are too big to transit the Panama Canal. The next category down is Panamax, which is the maximum size ship that can use the Panama Canal (although new locks are due to open in 2015).

3025	We have nine ships that can fit, but we choose not to offer Panama Canal cruises. We have no desire for it.. CORRECTION: A story in Travel Weekly's July 25 print edition incorrectly said that the canal expansion would accommodate all current cruise ships, rendering the term post-Panamax obsolete.
3026	118 New Ships Since 2000 - Ship Sizes - The New Panama Canal. The recent announcement by CLIA that 118 new cruise ships had been delivered since 2000 has led The Cruise Examiner to have a look at how the world cruise fleet is now made up and how it has changed in the last decade. The findings, along with progress now being made on a new Panama Canal, are rather interesting.
3027	Most cruise ships transiting the Panama Canal will continue to use the old locks. Cruise lines have several ships operating in Alaska that would need the new locks to move to the Atlantic, such as Royal Caribbean Internationalâs Explorer of the Seas and Celebrity Cruisesâ Celebrity Solstice.
3028	Only one cruise ship has reserved space to move through the new locks, which are open to one cruise ship a day starting in June 2017, according to the Panama Canal Authority. Princess Cruises' Caribbean Princess is scheduled to make a series of thirteen 10-day cruises through the canal beginning Oct. 21, 2017.
3029	Just one cruise ship scheduled to use new Panama Canal locks. The new, wider locks on the Panama Canal will open June 26 with the first official transit of a cargo ship, but donât expect much traffic through them from cruise ships.
3030	As cruise ships carry passengers and not heavy cargoes, this is not a problem for them, as even the Queen Mary 2 has only a draft of 32 feet 10 inches, which means that there is really no such thing as a Suezmax cruise ship.
3031	The eleven ships of the Carnival Conquest (six) and Costa Concordia (five) classes, all 952 by 116 feet in overall dimensions, are ten feet too wide for the present Panama Canal. Eleven more ships, of the Grand Princess class, including P&O's Azura and Ventura, all 951 x 118 feet, also fall into this category.

3193	Astrocytes B. Dendritic cells C. Langerhans cells D. T lymphocytes E. B lymphocytes Option D (T lymphocytes) is correct. Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs) are found primarily in the skin, lymph nodes, spleen and thymus. They may also be present throughout the diffuse lymphoid system.
3194	Main articles: T cell and B cell. T cells (thymus cells) and B cells (bone marrow-or bursa-derived cells) are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response. T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas B cells are primarily responsible for humoral immunity (relating to antibodies). The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific ânon-selfâ antigens, during a process known as antigen presentation.
3195	Primary lymphoid tissues are the tissues in which lymphocytes are generated and differentiateinto mature naive naÃ¯ve: lymphocytes these are the bone marrow For b, cells and the bone marrow andthe thymus For t; cells they will be discussed In chapter. 7
3196	Inlymph nodes (a) , spleen (b) and the Peyerâspatches of the small intestine (c) , the B cellzones are seen as defined follicles; functionallyequivalent areas, not all as well defined, arefound in all mucosal lymphoid tissues.Proliferating B cells are concentrated in thegerminal centers.
3197	Secondary lymphoid tissues arethe tissues in which immune responses are initiated, and the lymphatic vessels that connectthem to the tissues and the bloodstream and thus to sites of infection (Figure 1-18).
3198	Conversely, at sites of chronic inflammation, organized lymphoid tissue mayform: this is known as tertiary lymphoid tissue. Overview of the Immune Response Chapter 1 15 Figure 1-19 Secondary lymphoid tissues Thespecialized sites of T cell activation are coloredpurple; the sites of B cell activation are blue.
3199	They include natural killer cells (NK cells) (which function in cell-mediated, cytotoxic innate immunity), T cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic adaptive immunity), and B cells (for humoral, antibody-driven adaptive immunity). They are the main type of cell found in lymph, which prompted the name lymphocyte.
3200	B Lymphocytes â¢ Develop from stem cells in the bone marrow. â¢ Produce antibodies with specificity for antigens. â¢ Plasma cells = Activated B cells. â¢ Upon activation, a B cell can switch to produce a different class of antibody, with the same antigen specificity.
3201	The three major types of lymphocyte are T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Lymphocytes can be identified by their large nucleus.
3202	The T cell regions (purple)are adjacent to the B cell follicles. In the spleen,these form the periarteriolar lymphatic sheaths(PALS) and are surrounded by a region knownas the marginal zone, which we describe in thenext section.

I genuinely love my job (and a lot of people, with or without depression, donât always feel that way about their jobs, so I know that makes me a little weird in its own merit).
3349	1. Eat it for: The B vitamins and protein. Egg yolks are the vitamin-B-rich part of the egg. Other examples: Lean beef, wheat germ, fish, poultry. Why they help: A diet rich in B vitamins can help lessen the severity of depression symptoms.
3350	1. Thereâs a difference between sadness and depression, and though that doesnât take away from a diagnosis, it is empowering as a distinction. Though you may feel depressed, a person who has depression is not always a âdepressed person,â in whatever way â hyperbolic or otherwise â that phrase has come to mean.
3351	While any whole grain is good, so-called ancient grains are even better, according to Reardon, because they're less likely to be man-modified and processed. Packaged, processed, and refined foods made with wheat flour and sugar, in contrast, tend to be digested quickly, causing cause blood sugar to spike.
3352	Why they help: There's a reason fish is known as brain food.. Fatty fish such as wild salmon contain the omega-3 fatty acid DHA, which has been shown to increase the membrane quality and nerve function of gray matter in the brain.
3353	The human femur can resist forces of 1,800 to 2,500 pounds, so it is not easily fractured. A break in this bone can only result from a large amount of force, such as a car accident or a fall from an extreme height. Such an injury can take three to six months to heal. Back to Leg.

3356	Femur. The femur is the only bone located within the human thigh. It is both the longest and the strongest bone in the human body, extending from the hip to the knee. Important features of this bone include the head, medial and lateral condyles, patellar surface, medial and lateral epicondyles, and greater and lesser trochanters.
3357	The human skeleton is the internal framework of the body. It is composed of 270 bones at birth â this total decreases to 206 bones by adulthood after some bones have fused together. The bone mass in the skeleton reaches maximum density around age 30. The human skeleton can be divided into the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton is formed by the vertebral column, the rib cage and the skull.
3358	The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and patella forming the knee joint.
3359	The femur (/ËfiËmÉr/) (pl. femurs or femora (/ËfÉmÉrÉ/)), or thigh bone, is the most proximal (closest to the center of the body) bone of the leg in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping, such as most land mammals, birds, many reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs.
3360	The human skeleton serves six major functions; support, movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage of ions and endocrine regulation.
3361	Structure [edit]. The femur is the only bone in the thigh. The two femurs converge medially toward the knees, where they articulate with the proximal ends of the tibiae. The angle of convergence of the femora is a major factor in determining the femoral-tibial angle.
3362	The femur is categorised as a long bone and comprises a diaphysis, the shaft (or body) and two epiphysis or extremities that articulate with adjacent bones in the hip and knee.
3363	II. Basic Elements Of Protein Structure A. Helices. The Î±-helix is the classic element of protein structure. A single Î±-helix can order as many as 35 residues whereas the longest Î² strands include only about 15 residues, and one helix can have more influence on the stability and organization of a protein than any other individual structure element.
3364	A. Helices. 1  The Î±-helix is the classic element of protein structure. A single Î±-helix can order as many as 35 residues whereas the longest Î² strands include only about 15 residues, and one helix can have more influence on the stability and organization of a protein than any other individual structure element.
3365	Alpha Helices. The alpha helix is a rod-like structure whose inner section is formed by a tightly coiled main chain, with its side chains extending outward in a helical array. The alpha helix structure takes advantage of the hydrogen bond between CO and NH groups of the main chain to stabilize. The CO group of each amino acid forms a hydrogen bond with the NH group of amino acid four residues earlier in the sequence.
3366	The only other principal helical species besides the Î±-helix which occurs to any great extent in globular protein structure is the 3 10-helix (see Fig. 17), with a three-residue repeat and a hydrogen bond to residue n + 3 instead of n + 4.
3367	backbone is coiled up like a very tight clockwise screw thread or the cord of a telephone. The peptide link plates form the wall of the tube with the Ca atoms projecting a little from the surface. The side chain groups, attached to the Ca atoms, project outwards from the wall of the tube (figure 8).
3368	A level chemistry resource. Protein structure The a-helix. Secondary structure (continued) We can describe the arrangement of a
3369	The right-handed Î±-helix is the most common secondary structure found in protein, with 3.6 amino acid residues observed per turn of the helix (Fig. 4-5).
3370	Handedness is an enormously influential parameter in protein structure; most features for which handedness can be defined prefer one sense to the other, and the Î±-helix is only the first of many examples we will encounter.
3371	The a-helix. 3.2 Secondary structure (continued) We can describe the arrangement of atoms around the peptide link (the conformation) by giving the degree and direction in which the Ca-CO and N-Ca bonds are rotated. When a number of successive peptide links have identical rotations the polypeptide chain takes up a particular secondary structure. There are several types of secondary structure, but we will concentrate on just two: the a-helix and the b-pleated sheet. In both cases you will see how the regular conformation allows the structure to be stabilised by forming many relatively strong hydrogen bonds. The a-helix The a-helix is like a narrow-bore tube.
3372	The helix dipole may contribute to the binding of charged species to the protein: for example, negative nucleotide phosphates, which are typically found near the N-termini of helices. FIG. 17. A short segment of 310 helix from carbonic anhydrase (residues 159-164). Main chain carbonyl oxygens are shown as open circles.
3373	Thus, a drop in the price level decreases the interest rate, which increases the demand for investment and thereby increases aggregate demand. The third reason for the downward slope of the aggregate demand curve is Mundell-Fleming's exchange-rate effect.
3374	(This is known as the law of demand.). In contrast, the aggregate demand curve used in macroeconomics shows the relationship between the overall (i.e. average) price level in an economy, usually represented by the GDP Deflator, and the total amount of all goods demanded in an economy.
3375	The first reason for the downward slope of the aggregate demand curve is Pigou's wealth effect. Recall that the nominal value of money is fixed, but the real value is dependent upon the price level. This is because for a given amount of money, a lower price level provides more purchasing power per unit of currency.
3376	DEFINITION of 'Aggregate Demand'. The total amount of goods and services demanded in the economy at a given overall price level and in a given time period. It is represented by the aggregate-demand curve, which describes the relationship between price levels and the quantity of output that firms are willing to provide. Normally there is a negative relationship between aggregate demand and the price level. Also known as total spending.
3377	The most noticeable feature of the aggregate demand curve is that it is downward sloping, as seen in. There are a number of reasons for this relationship. Recall that a downward sloping aggregate demand curve means that as the price level drops, the quantity of output demanded increases. Similarly, as the price level drops, the national income increases. There are three basic reasons for the downward sloping aggregate demand curve.
3378	(Note that goods in this context technically refers to both goods and services.) Specifically, the aggregate demand curve shows real GDP, which, in equilibrium, represents both total output and total income in an economy, on its horizontal axis.
3379	Students learn in microeconomics that the demand curve for a good, which shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of the good that consumers demand-i.e. are willing, ready, and able to purchase-has a negative slope.
3380	Aggregate demand is the demand for the gross domestic product (GDP) of a country, and is represented by this formula: Aggregate Demand (AD) = C + I + G + (X-M) C = Consumers' expenditures on goods and services. I = Investment spending by companies on capital goods.
3381	Therefore, the aggregate demand curve must slope downwards for different reasons. In fact, there are three reasons why the aggregate demand curve exhibits this pattern: the wealth effect, the interest-rate effect, and the exchange-rate effect.
3382	(Technically, in the context of aggregate demand, the Y on the horizontal axis represents aggregate expenditure .) As it turns out, the aggregate demand curve also slopes downwards, giving a similar negative relationship between price and quantity that exists with the demand curve for a single good.
3383	Niger has an extremely low literacy rate at 28.7%. However, the gender gap between males and females is a major problem for the country, males have a literacy rate of 42.9% and females a literacy rate of 15.1%. The Nigerien government defines literacy as anyone who can read or write over the age of 15.

3385	There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Most presented rates are based on the ability to read and write at a specified age. Information on literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the most easily available and valid for international comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic development of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven world.
3386	The literacy rate in Kenya among people below 20 years of age is over 70%, as the first 8 years of primary school are provided tuition-free by the government. In January 2008, the government began offering a restricted program of free secondary education.
3387	Senegal has a literacy rate of 49.7%; the government defines literacy as anyone who is at least 15 years of age and over who can read and write. However, many students do not attend school long enough to be considered literate.

3393	Often, the first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood. This test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia.
3394	To evaluate your body's current level of iron. When your doctor suspects that you may have too little or too much iron in your system. A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm. Your doctor may request that you fast for 12 hours prior to some iron tests; in this case, only water is permitted.
3395	Transferrin level, or total iron-binding capacity. Transferrin is a protein that carries iron in your blood. Total iron-binding capacity measures how much of the transferrin in your blood isn't carrying iron. If you have iron-deficiency anemia, you'll have a high level of transferrin that has no iron.
3396	The amount of ferritin in the blood (serum ferritin level) is directly related to the amount of iron stored in your body. Iron is important for red blood cell production. Your doctor may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of anemia due to low iron.
3397	Ferritin blood test. The ferritin blood test measures the level of ferritin in the blood. Ferritin is a protein found inside cells that stores iron so your body can use it later. A ferritin test indirectly measures the amount of iron in your blood. A blood sample is needed.
3398	Hemoglobin, serum iron, TIBC or UIBC and serum ferritin are sufficient to establish a basic picture of oneâs iron status, but in conditions of disease that may be due to blood cell production or cancers, other tests or procedures are needed to determine the cause for abnormal iron levels.
3399	We are now offering Direct-to-Consumer Blood Tests! Iron Disorders Institute (IDI), in partnership with its affiliate Health-e-Iron LLC, are now offering direct-to-consumer lab tests. Test vouchers can be purchased online in 45 participating states and the District of Columbia.

3401	Hemoglobin measures functional iron. This iron delivers oxygen to cells and carries carbon dioxide away from cells. Serum iron: is a test that measures the iron level in your blood. Serum ferritin is often referred to as the bodyâs place for storing iron.
3402	For this test, a sample of your blood is examined under a microscope. If you have iron-deficiency anemia, your red blood cells will look smaller and paler than normal. Tests to measure iron levels. These tests can show how much iron has been used from your body's stored iron.
3403	The protein is shorter than usual and does not contain all the amino acids that it should. Therefore, this protein is most likely nonfunctional. Frameshift Mutations Another type of mutation is a frameshift mutation which is caused by the insertion or a deletion of a base pair. An inserted or deleted nucleotide alters the triplet grouping of nucleotides into codons and shifts the reading frame so that all nucleotides downstream from the mutation will be improperly grouped.
3404	So, the 2 types of frameshift mutations are insertion & deletion. A frameshift is always serious, because the entire genetic code is messed up from the point of insertion/deletion onward. A point mutation means that 1 single base is altered.
3405	A point mutation will change only one particular base of the codon, so it will only cause a change in one of the amino acids that will make up the protein. A deletion mutatiâ¦on will completely remove a base- causing a change in every amino acid that follows the deletion.

3407	point mutation has transition (when a purine base is substituted with another purine or pyramidine with pyramidine) or transversion (purine with pyramidine or vice versa) point mutations give rise to silent mutation, nonsense mutation and missense mutation. silent mutations are the least harmful cause their change of the base does not result in anything cause they code for the same amino acid. missense codes for a different amino acid, and nonsense codes for a stop codon.
3408	a framshift mutation does not occur in multiples of threes. if you know, three nucleotide makes up an amino acid. so if there are a deletion or insertion in the middle, that means that all the nucleotides from that mutation on is 'shifted' in a very incorrect fashion. frameshift mutation is thus very harmful.
3409	A point mutation is a change in a single base pair in DNA. A change in a single nitrogenous base can change the entire structure of a protein because a change in a single aminâ¦o acid can affect the shape of the protein. A frameshift mutation is a mutation in which a single base is added or deleted from DNA.
3410	Frameshift mutation. A frameshift mutation (also called a framing error or a reading frame shift) is a genetic mutation caused by indels (insertions or deletions) of a number of nucleotides in a DNA sequence that is not divisible by three.
3411	Insertion mutations can affect many amino acids in the protein. An insertion mutation usually causes more defects during protein  synthesis than point mutation because an insâ¦ertion mutation will  affect many amino acids in the protein.

3423	The boundaries of the Republic of West Florida included all territory south of the 31st parallel, west of the Pearl River, and east of the Mississippi River, but north of Lake Pontchartrain. The southern boundary was the Gulf of Mexico.
3424	In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson purchased the territory of Louisiana from the French government for $15 million. The Louisiana Purchase stretched from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains and from Canada to New Orleans, and it doubled the size of the United States.
3425	1 Connecticut put forth a claim to a swath of land from its western boundary to the Mississippi River. 2  A claim to a portion of Pennsylvania (not shown on the map) was asserted only half-heartedly because of the strength of a more recent charter held by that state.
3426	1 Connecticut and New York jointly claimed lands in the Old Northwest, but New York surrendered its rights in 1785 and Connecticut followed the next year. 2  However, Connecticut's claim to an area known as the Western Reserve was maintained until 1795, when it was purchased by the Connecticut Land Company. 3  Massachusetts.
3427	1 A portion of this claim was added to northern Georgia and the remainder was ceded to the central government. 2  Georgia. 3  Georgia, possessor of the weakest claim to western lands, held out the longest. 4  The area that later became Alabama and Mississippi were given up in 1802, which completed the process of surrender.
3428	West Florida was a region on the north shore of the Gulf of Mexico, which underwent several boundary and sovereignty changes during its history. The province was established by the British in 1763 out of lands ceded from the Spanish and French.
3429	The claims to the western lands were usually rooted in the vague wording of old colonial charters. The picture was further complicated by the fact that the claims often overlapped one another, which pitted one state's interests against another.
3430	This was soon annexed by the United States, which claimed the region as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. In 1819 the United States negotiated the purchase of the remainder of West Florida and all of East Florida in the AdamsâOnis OnÃ­s, treaty and in 1822 both were merged into The Florida. territory

3443	When Will Baby Sleep in Their Bed? The reality is that your newborn is unlikely to sleep inside the the charming crib that you spent an entire day assembling until she is 6 months or older. Further your newborn should and probably will be sleeping with you IN YOUR ROOM for about the first 6 months.
3444	You should establish this bedtime habit early, when newborns are biologically programmed to fall asleep right after eating. Feed your baby, burp him, rock for a few minutes (if desired), and put him to bed in the crib. If your baby wonât sleep in the crib, see our article on getting baby to sleep in the crib.
3445	But babies donât know the difference between day and night. So they sleep with no regard for what time it is. That means your babyâs wide-awake time may be from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. By 3 to 6 months, many babies are able to sleep for a stretch of 6 hours.
3446	Very young newborns might also benefit from a sleep hat to conserve body heat and mittens to prevent scratches during sleep. For safety and sleep training purposes, newborns should also do most of their sleeping in a baby crib or bassinet.
3447	There are a number of compelling reasons for your baby to stay in your room for the first 6 months: 1  Safety. Numerous health organizations (such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, SIDS Alliance and NIH) suggest that the safest place for your newborn to sleep is in your room with you. 2  Convenience.
3448	By Dr. William Sears. Having counseled thousands of parentsâand having been one myselfâfor some 40 years, when I'm asked where baby should sleep I simply answer, Wherever all family members sleep the best.. Some infants need more sleeping closeness in the early months; others later on as they go through the normal stage of nighttime separation anxiety.

3555	In linguistics, a word is the smallest element that can be uttered in isolation with semantic or pragmatic content (with literal or practical meaning). This contrasts deeply with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own.
3556	The term word may refer to a spoken word or to a written word, or sometimes to the abstract concept behind either. Spoken words are made up of units of sound called phonemes, and written words of symbols called graphemes, such as the letters of the English alphabet.
3557	An abbreviation is a shortening of a word or a phrase. An acronym is an abbreviation that forms a word. An initialism is an abbreviation that uses the first letter of each word in the phrase (thus, some but not all initialisms are acronyms).
3558	Start Case. I too thought it is simply Title Case, until I read more in the Wikipedia article about letter cases - Letter case. Looks like Title Case does not capitalize certain parts of speech, (basically there are exceptions). A simple variant of that called Start Case, simply capitalize all the first letters of all the words.
3559	An acronym in which one of the letters stands for the actual word abbreviated therein is called a recursive acronym. (For example, VISA is said to stand for VISA International Service Association.) An acronym in which the short form was original and words made up to stand for it afterwards is called a backronym.
3560	The word for folder has an interesting history. It came into English in the 16th century from the French verb filer, to string on a thread. This relates to storing documents by tying them together with string. It comes from the Latin filum, meaning thread, from which we also get our word filament.
3561	Best Answer: This depends... The example you gave is an Acronym because the phrase created is made of one word pieces that accurately reflect the meaning of the root word. Also a useful definition is Acrostic. An acrostic is usually a poem with phrases in place of the one word pieces of an acronym.
3562	HOMONYMS  WORDS WITH MORE THAN ONE MEANING  WORDS WITH SEVERAL MEANINGS  WORDS WITH MULTIPLE MEANINGS. Homonyms. There is a strange puzzle in the English language  we have many words which have more than one meaning.

3611	A cardinal's nest is a bulky structure of vines, leave and twigs. It is often hidden in a thicket. The nest is usually within ten feet of the ground. Three to four cardinal eggs will hatch after twelve days, and the fledglings leave the nest when they're between ten and twelve days old. Plant seeds and fruits comprise 90 percent of the cardinal's food in the fall and winter, and 40 to 50 percent of their food in the summer.
3612	Nestlings and eggs are eaten by snakes, birds and small mammals. Predators of eggs and nestlings include milk snakes, black racers, pilot black snakes, blue jays, fox squirrels, red squirrels and eastern chipmunks. Brown-headed cowbirds also take cardinal eggs from the nest and sometimes eat them.
3613	Cardinals, in the family Cardinalidae, are passerine birds found in North and South America. They are also known as cardinal-grosbeaks and cardinal-buntings. The South American cardinals in the genus Paroaria are placed in another family, the Thraupidae (previously placed in Emberizidae).
3614	They are robust, seed-eating birds with strong bills. The family ranges in size from the 12-cm (4.7-in), 11.5-g (0.40-oz) and up orange-breasted bunting to the 25-cm (9.8-in), 85-g (2.99-oz) black-headed saltator. They are typically associated with open woodland. The sexes usually have distinctive appearances.
3615	Cardinals are very adaptable. They are found in hardwood forest habitats, small rural and urban woodlots, farmstead, orchards and urban backyards. They do best where there is thick, shrubby growth for them to nest and roost in.
3616	The female northern cardinal builds the nest and incubates the eggs. When the chicks hatch they have no feathers or down, so the female broods them to protect them and keep them warm for at least 2 days. Both parents feed the chicks a diet of insects.
3617	Northern cardinals are found throughout eastern and central North America from southern Canada into parts of Mexico and Central America. These birds live as far north as Maine or Nova Scotia, Canada down south through Florida and the Gulf Coast. They range as far west as South Dakota, Nebraska and Texas. They have also been introduced to California, Hawaii and Bermuda. Northern cardinals do not migrate so they live in the same place year-round. (Halkin and Linville, 1999; Sibley, 2000)
3618	Cardinals however, can be extremely skittish, shy and secretive when theyâre nesting. So, although Duncraft has just introduced a nesting shelf specifically for Cardinals, it may take a while for your cardinals to discover the benefits of building their nest in one.
3619	As low as $29.99. The Cardinal is probably one of the most recognizable and popular backyard birds because of its brilliant red color and crested head. It is a great bird to admire year-round. The color contrast of the brilliant red against fresh white snow really is a high point during the winter months. Early settlers were said to have named this bird after the Cardinals of the Catholic Church who wore red robes.
3620	We think Duncraftâs Cardinal House will do just that! With a little luck, our finicky Cardinals may come to learn that the nesting shelves we provide for them are sturdy, dry and provide a secure platform for their nests. In time, the birds may become less wary of them. Safer nests will help to ensure the future of this beautiful bird! âR.

3631	There are many more things you should know about COBRA. Here are 10. 1. Certain qualifying events trigger 36 months of COBRA coverage for your dependents. Voluntary or involuntary job loss (except in instances of gross misconduct) triggers 18 months of COBRA coverage for you and your dependents.
3632	If you choose to take Cobra coverage, you must keep the health plan you had before you lost your job. After you are in Cobra, you can switch plans â if you should want lower-cost coverage, for instance â when the companyâs active employees go through open enrollment.
3633	You have to have Health Insurance in 2014 and forward. If you do not have health insurance (specifically Qualified Health Plan â QHP) you will pay a penalty (tax). The penalty for 2014 is the greater of $95 or 1% of house hold income reported on last yearâs tax statement (the penalty will increase in 2015, and 2016).
3634	Because of that, only a relatively small share of employees who are eligible for Cobra benefits generally choose to take them. However, if you were laid off between Sept. 1, 2008, and the end of 2009, you might qualify for a federal subsidy that would help you pay to keep workplace health insurance for nine months.
3635	When does COBRA continuation coverage start. COBRA is always effective the day after your active coverage ends. For most, active coverage terminates at the end of a month and COBRA is effective on the first day of the next month.
3636	Effective for all health plans with plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, the Affordable Care Act prohibits health insurance issuers from limiting or excluding coverage related to pre-existing health conditions, regardless of the age of the covered individual.
3637	Under COBRA, if you voluntarily resign from a job or are terminated for any reason other than gross misconduct you are guaranteed the right to continue your former employer's group plan as individual or family health care coverage for up to 18 months, at your own expense.
3638	The protection generally lasts up to 18 months, and you must opt for Cobra within 60 days of losing your job or of receiving formal notification that you are eligible for the program, whichever is later. The statute includes only companies with 20 or more employees that are continuing to offer a health plan.
3639	The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 contains a provision that gives qualified COBRA participants a 65 percent federal subsidy to pay their COBRA premiums for up to fifteen months. You can take advantage of this assistance if you became eligible for COBRA from Sept. 1, 2008, to May 31, 2010. This applies to workers (and their spouses and dependents) who were involuntarily terminated (including those laid off) or had a reduction in work hours that led to loss of health insurance benefits.
3640	COBRA Premiums. COBRA is not an insurance company nor is it health insurance. COBRA is an abbreviation for a federal regulation that governs how and when a qualified beneficiary can continue terminated group health insurance coverage for a specified period of time by self-paying the premium.
3641	Why did the Dodo go Extinct. The dodo was a large flightless bird was native to the Island of Mauritius (located to the east of Africa and Madagascar). This species is best known for becoming extinct in the 17th century, with the last sighting of this species in 1688.
3642	A video of what looks like a living specimen has a lot of people wondering and hoping. The Myanmar Jerdonâs babbler (Chrysomma altirostre) was discovered by British naturalist T. C. Jerdon in 1862, when the sparrow-sized birds were common in the Ayeyarwady and Sittaung river floodplains.
3643	Thatâs what was said about the Myanmar Jerdonâs babbler, which was declared extinct after not having been seen since 1941. Last week, researchers confirmed that several adult Jerdonâs babblers were seen early last year. Could the dodo bird be found alive too?
3644	Why did the Dodo go Extinct. 19 Sep, 2013 animals 2. The dodo was a large flightless bird was native to the Island of Mauritius (located to the east of Africa and Madagascar). This species is best known for becoming extinct in the 17th century, with the last sighting of this species in 1688.
3645	While familiarity with extinct animals varies, the dodo bird and the woolly mammoth can be considered generally well-known. The phrase to go the way of the dodo is a common reminder of the bird's extinction. The woolly mammoth went extinct in prehistoric times but still makes scientific headlines.
3646	When did the dodo become extinct? As of 2015, the generally accepted date of extinction for the dodo is 1662, the date of the last reliable sighting. However, reports of sightings exist up through the end of the 1600s. Some date the extinction to 1681, due to an account of dodos hunted and eaten on Mauritius.
3647	The evidence that the dodo bird (Raphus Cucullatus), extinct since 1681, could be alive is not quite as solid but still interesting. A night vision video recently uploaded to the Internet shows what appears to be a live dodo walking past an iguana.
3648	The dodo bird became extinct because it was adapted to an ecosystem that had few predators. When humans began development on their island (Mauritius), the birds were rapidly dâ¦ecimated by hunting and by new predators (dogs, rats). In less than 80 years, their entire population was gone.

3671	Due to the needs for proper harvesting and curing tobacco, there is very little home or garden production of tobacco for personal use. Another deterrent to home production of tobacco is the need to age the cured tobacco for one to three years or longer.
3672	Soil Nutrients. Nicotiana tabacum requires many essential elements in order for survival including: carbon, nitrogen, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, manganese, boron, copper, zinc, and chlorine. The main flow of all these nutrients is from the roots, through the stem, and eventually to the leaves. The top of the plant which produces the flowers is the main destination for all of the nutrients. Carbon: Carbon makes up about 40 percent of the dry tobacco leaf right after it has been cured.
3673	Growing Tobacco in the Home Garden1 By E.B. Whitty2. Many homeowners wish to grow a few plants of tobacco in their yard or garden for ornamental purposes or for personal use. Tobacco plants are usually no more difficult to grow than many other garden plants, but it is difficult to cure, age, and process tobacco without specialized facilities.
3674	Nitrogen: Nitrogen is a very important element in the growth and quality of the tobacco leaf. Nitrogen has a major role in the content of nicotine, chlorophyll, and other important substances in the leaf that are essential for growth.
3675	HARVESTING AND CURING. Due to the needs for proper harvesting and curing tobacco, there is very little home or garden production of tobacco for personal use. Another deterrent to home production of tobacco is the need to age the cured tobacco for one to three years or longer.
3676	Soil pH should be about 5.8 for best growth of tobacco. If lime is needed to raise the pH, use dolomite in order to get the magnesium nutrient which is important for plant growth. Poor growth and some growth disorders may occur if the soil pH is about 6.5 or more.
3677	Potassium: Tobacco requires a large amount of potassium to reach a healthy and mature plant. When potassium levels are not up to par the plant will develop cankers of dead tissue forming on the plant body, and the tips of the leaves will turn a brownish color.
3678	By E.B. Whitty2. Many homeowners wish to grow a few plants of tobacco in their yard or garden for ornamental purposes or for personal use.

Maximum heart rates can exceed 180 beats per minute, but a rate above 80 should be considered serious in most non-exercising horses.he average respiration rate of a mature horse at rest is 8-15 breaths per minute. A horseâs respiration rate increases with hot or humid weather, exercise, fever or pain. Rapid breathing at rest should receive veterinary attention, and keep in mind that the respiration rate should NEVER exceed the pulse rate.
3742	HORSE HEART RATE. An adult horse at rest will have a pulse rate ranging from 30 to 40 beats per minute. Foals will have a pulse rate ranging from 70 to 120, yearlings from 45 to 60 and two-year-olds from 40 to 50.If you are using a stethoscope, place it on the horse s girth area just behind the left elbow.he sounds you hear (if you have your speakers on) is the heart of a horse recovering after ten minutes of loping.

3746	For adults 18 and older, a normal resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the personâs physical condition and age. For children ages 6 to 15, the normal resting heart rate is between 70 and 100 bpm, according to the AHA.eart rate, also known as pulse, is the number of times a person's heart beats per minute. A normal heart rate depends on the individual, age, body size, heart conditions, whether the person is sitting or moving, medication use and even air temperature. Even emotions can have an impact on heart rate.

3748	Liposuction performed with this solution is often called tumescent liposuction. In addition, liposuction is also characterized by the technology that disrupts fat. Traditional liposuction, often referred to as suction-assisted liposuction or SAL, involves removing fat with a cannula attached to a suction apparatus.
3749	If you take a quick survey of the many liposuction/cosmetic surgery websites currently on the Internet, youâll find that the cost of liposuction can vary greatly across the US, but generally boils down to three primary factors:
3750	Factors Determining the Cost of Liposuction. First of all, the type of market depends on the area you live. For example the price for liposuction in New York is more compared to that of Omaha. However, in areas that experience high labor expenses and high rent, you should be prepared to pay more for your liposuction.
3751	For instance, the total amount of liposuction carried out on the buttocks, outer thighs and hips is determined by summing up say $2500 for hips, $3200 for outer thighs, $1900 for buttocks plus a surgical fee of $1700.
3752	Costs of Liposuction. the cost of the operating facility/or hospital and supportive/nursing staff. Other costs routinely include pre-op lab fees (blood work or other tests), cost of the elastic compression garments youâll need, medications and prescriptions, and any specialized technology that may be used.
3753	There 2 types of fat in the body. Only the Subcutaneous Fat is removed by the body. 1  Subcutaneous Fat: The fat that lies just under the skin; it acts as a buffer to support the skin and is an energy storage material.  Visceral Fat: This is the fat that is packed around the organs.
3754	Liposuction in three areas of the body can range from $6000 to $8000, and in five areas, as high as $11,000. (Because most plastic surgeons offer âpackage dealsâ whereby a patient can have multiple areas treated while paying a flat fee for the operating facility and anesthesia, many choose this option.)
3755	The cost of liposuction varies based on the extend of your surgery and the cost of any additional surgery. The average cost of liposuction is around $2000. Remember, the total cost depends on the number of areas needing liposuction. Everyone is different.
3756	The best way to know the cost of your liposuction is to be evaluated during a consultation. To make liposuction affordable for you, we offer patient financing plans, so be sure to ask. Most health insurance plans will not cover liposuction, related complications or another surgery to revise the appearance of your body.
3757	What Is Liposuction? Liposuction is defined as a surgical method that gets rid of fat that has accumulated on certain parts of the body. The fat is removed from body parts such as the neck, hips, buttocks, abdomen or arms using a suction technique to improve their body shape contours. Liposuction is also known as body contouring or lipoplasty. Liposuction cannot be largely considered as weight loss for the entire body or an alternative to losing weight.
3758	Quick Answer. Standard computer monitor sizes include 17, 20 , 24 and 27 inches, as of 2015. Monitors are typically between 15 and 34 inches, but monitors between 17 and 30 inches are the most common sizes. Continue Reading.
3759	Best Answer: People don`t buy average size monitors. They buy one based on what they want to use if for and price. For a school project a basic 17 -19 ins would do for a desktop. 15 ins for a latop.You don`t want to blow the school`s annual budget.
3760	Your best bet is to get the biggest computer monitor that you can. There are a bunch of reasons why you should do this. If you have a MacBook, then the new 27-inch LED Apple Cinema Display is one of the most convenient monitors to have, thanks to its host of features that are geared towards MacBooks.
3761	Standard computer wallpaper sizes are always changing because they are relative to the current popular monitor resolutions. Ideally, a computer's wallpaper will share the same resolution as the screen, which provides the best possible picture quality while using the least amount of computer resources possible.
3762	The standard wallpaper sizes are determined by the most popular resolutions of the time. For example, most computer monitors ran the 1024x768 resolution for years until widescreen monitors grew in popularity, making 1366x768 the most popular resolution. A couple is measuring their wallpaper.
3763	This display aspect ratio is the native resolution for many 24 widescreen LCD monitors, and is expected to also become a standard resolution for smaller to medium-size, wide-aspect tablet computers in the near future (as of 2012).
3764	The 1920x1200 standard wallpaper size covers all the bases for screens running in a 16:10 aspect ratio. While 16:10 screens make up a large share of computer monitors, the devices are spread out between four different resolutions: 1920x1200, 1680x1050, 1440x900 and 1200x800.
3765	What's the Best Computer Monitor Size? With a lot of people using their laptops as a desktop computer replacement, you'd think that smaller monitors might be better, but in all honesty, if you're looking for a new monitor, your best bet is to read on to find out what we think about computer monitor sizes.
3766	The average size for a laptop is 15 inches but they range from 11 to 19 inches. The average size of the monitor for a desktop computer, on the other hand, is 23 inches I believe. You can find whatever size you desire. From 17 to 35 inches.
3767	Computer display standards are a combination of aspect ratio, display size, display resolution, color depth, and refresh rate. They are associated with specific expansion cards, video connectors and monitors. 1 History.

3769	Information you need to check the status of your refund: Social Security Number Filing status Exact refund amount In the news, the Internal Revenue Service has $760 million in unclaimed refunds it wants to give to the rightful owners.
3770	1 Hire an accountant or tax services firm to follow up this issue on your behalf particularly if you have a tax obligation to the IRS. 2  But be warned, these are not the cheapest options and if you refund is less than $1,000 it may not be worth the cost.
3771	}Â¡{blessed}i{. According to Georgia Department of Revenue website, their office issues most refunds within 30 business days. You may check the status of your refund on-line at Georgia Tax Center. You can start checking on the status of your return within 24 hours after they have received your e-filed return or 4 weeks after you mail a paper return. Before making an inquiry, please allow: 1  4 weeks for returns filed electronically. 2  6 weeks for paper returns filed prior to April 1st.

3773	When it comes to tax season I receive a lot of reader questions, many tinged with a hint of desperation, around why IRS tax refunds are taking so long and what can be done to get refunds sooner rather than later. Here is a sampling of comments from the current and past tax seasons: Help me please.
3774	1 Check the IRS tax tool, whereâs my refund, to get the official status of your refund (see estimated IRS refund schedule). 2  It is updated daily and provides the latest processing status of your tax refund. 3  The IRS has announced that it expects to issue more than 90% of refunds to taxpayers in less than 21 days.
3775	The reason it is taking so long for some folks is due to the surge in identity theft. The IRS is taking longer to process/review returns which is yielding success in reducing identity theft but also has a side effect: delayed tax refunds for many legitimate filers.
3776	0. 0. Georgia Department of Revenue usually sends refund within 21 business days from the date they receive it. You can check the status of your refund within 24 hours after they have received it if you filed it electronically or check the status after 4 weeks if you mailed your return.
3777	It`s been over a month since Georgia received my taxes & I have called 5 times speaking to 5 different people & have been told 5 different stories! I was also told nothing is wrong with my information.
3778	It is ve â¦ ry very important to maintain your homeostasis. If your body is not functioning properly to maintain the right body temperature you could die. Think about it, if your body doesn't do what it is supposed to do then your body temp can drop drastically if you are cold or raise if you are hot.
3779	1 To identify and example of two organ systems working together to maintain homeostasis. 2  To summarize the role of the endocrine system in homeostasis. 3  To outline the result of a disturbance in homeostasis of a body system.
3780	1 To explain the role of feedback mechanisms in homeostasis. 2  To distinguish negative feedback from positive feedback. 3  To identify and example of two organ systems working together to maintain homeostasis. 4  To summarize the role of the endocrine system in homeostasis.
3781	Feedback Regulation Loops. The endocrine system plays an important role in homeostasis because hormones regulate the activity of body cells. The release of hormones into the blood is controlled by a stimulus. For example, the stimulus either causes an increase or a decrease in the amount of hormone secreted.
3782	Disease as Failure of Homeostatic Mechanisms. Homeostasis is so important that, when it fails, it usually results in serious bodily damage. For example, the disease diabetes is a failure in the homeostasis of blood sugar. People with diabetes tend to have very high levels of sugar in their blood right after they eat and then very low levels in between meals.
3783	It is an organismâs ability to keep a constant internal environment. Homeostasis is an important characteristic of living things. Keeping a stable internal environment requires constant adjustments as conditions change inside and outside the cell. The adjusting of systems within a cell is called homeostatic regulation.

3785	Instructor: Natalia Caporale. Homeostasis can be defined as a property of an organism or system that helps it maintain its parameters within a normal range of values. It is key to life, and failures in homeostasis can lead to diseases like hypertension and diabetes.
3786	Making the world better, one answer at a time. Homeostasis is the conditions the organism needs to work at maximum efficiency. If an organism doesn't maintain homeostasis, the organism won't be able to operate at full capacity. Living things respond to stimuli that occur inside them. Their temperature also must be within a certain range.
3787	PTH is the primary hormone that protects against hypocalcimia, so it is stimulated to secrete by low circulating [Ca++], which is sensed by the parathyroid chief cell through a CaSR (Ca++-sensing receptor, GPCR).
3788	Choose the Right Type of Mint: 1  Spearmint and peppermint are the most popular types of mint. If you like chocolate, then mint chocolate may be the plant for you. 2  There around 3,500 varieties of mint, so there truly is a taste for every palette.
3789	If you're going to grow mint in a container, I would chose a nice BIG and deep one and mix 'em up (spearmint, peppermint, orange mint, apple mint, chocolate mint, lime mint, the varieties are endless!). It's nice to have different types.
3790	The peppermint herb is a leafy plant that doesnât grow more than 3 feet tall. Its leaves are fuzzy to the touch, and the plant gives off a faint peppery, sweet smell. Rubbing a peppermint leaf between fingers will release even more of the scent. Growing peppermint plants is incredibly easy.
3791	In fact, mint is a plant that is very mild in the conditions it requires. Supply your mother mint plant with enough water: unlike other plants, mint needs a lot of water. You do not need to water it the whole day long; I do it only once a day or twice if necessary. Just make sure the soil is always humid. A dead mint plant probably hasn't received enough water or sunlight.
3792	With light, sandy soil, the organic matter will help hold the water after rain or irrigation. If your soil has plenty of organic matter -- such as decayed leaves or compost -- worked into it, it will stay moist after a rain or irrigation. Organic matter acts like a sponge, holding moisture near the surface. That's good for onions, which have shallow roots and can't tap water or nutrients deep in the soil. If you're wondering about soil acidity or alkalinity (pH), onions do best if the soil pH is between 5.5 and 6.5, a little on the acid side.
3793	That means that the peppermint plant does not spread through pollination. That doesnât mean the peppermint plant doesnât grow well on itâs own. On the contrary, peppermint plants, and all itâs kin, are fast growers. The peppermint plant has been used and cultivated since ancient times.
3794	Here are the steps you need to follow in order to grow your own mint plant: 1  Buy yourself a mint plant. 2  Plant your mother plant in a larger pot. 3  Care for your mother plant: give it enough light and water.  Cut off a sprig and put it in a glass of 1  water. Wait, wait, wait.  Plant your new plant in a 1  pot. Drink  tea.
3795	As mentioned, the peppermint herb is the cross between water mint and spearmint. So, that makes at least two more types of mint. Altogether, there are over 600 varieties of mint, with sixteen of them being used the most today. Some of these varieties mess with the smell of mint and make for some interesting scents.
3796	How to Grow Mint Plants. Plant mint in full sun or part shade. It thrives in rich, moist, well-drained soil. Mint adapts to many soil types, but develops the best foliage in soil that has been enriched with a 2-inch-thick layer of compost. Frequent cutting keeps mint looking attractive.
3797	Mint will grow in most soils - you've got yours in a pot, so you should use a potting mix - any will do. In a cooler climate it will take full sun. In a hot climate it does best in partial shade. Mints prefer moist soil with excellent drainage and the soil should never be allowed to dry out completely. Mint is susceptible to rust. Keep manure away and remove any yellow-streaked sprigs to prevent the spread of the rust virus.
3798	Paranoid schizophrenia, schizophrenia, paranoid type is a sub-type of schizophrenia as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-IV code 295.30. It has been the most common type of schizophrenia.
3799	Schizophrenia can have a devastating impact on patients and their families. Patients with schizophrenia have increased risk for self-destructive behaviors and suicide. The antipsychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia can have severe side effects, including increased risk of obesity and diabetes.
3800	Although paranoid schizophrenia is defined by those two symptoms, it is also defined by a lack of certain symptoms (negative symptoms). The following symptoms are not prominent: âdisorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, or flat or inappropriate affect..
3801	About 60% of people with schizophrenia have no close relatives with the illness. Researchers are seeking the specific genetic factors that may be responsible for schizophrenia. Genes under investigation include the neuregulin-1 gene, the OLIG2 gene, and the COMT gene.
3802	Most antipsychotic medications are approved only for adult patients. Some atypical antipsychotics (such as risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetapine) are approved for treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents (ages 13 - 17 years).
3803	1 The patient may firmly believe something, even though there is incontrovertible evidence that it is false. En example may be a belief that a neighbor is plotting to kill or poison the patient.  Anxiety - a patient with paranoid schizophrenia will usually suffer from periods of high anxiety.
3804	Common symptoms for paranoid schizophrenia include auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and paranoid delusions (believing everyone is out to cause the sufferer harm). However, two of the symptoms separate this form of schizophrenia from other forms.
3805	Another criterion present in patients with paranoid schizophrenia is auditory hallucinations, in which the person hears voices or sounds that are not really present. The patient will sometimes hear multiple voices and the voices can either be talking to the patient or to one another.
3806	Patients with paranoid schizophrenia are more likely to be affected by positive symptoms, such as delusions and auditory hallucinations, and less by problems with mood, cognition (thinking, concentration, attention), compared to other types of schizophrenia.
3807	Paranoid Schizophrenia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatments. Paranoid schizophrenia is a subtype of schizophrenia in which the patient has delusions (false beliefs) that a person or some individuals are plotting against them or members of their family. Paranoid schizophrenia is the most common schizophrenia type.
3808	This is the ratio of the adiabatic elasticity of air to the isothermal elasticity. Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, Volume 13, Slice 2 Various. But let us assume that we have a compressor which shows an adiabatic pressure line.
3809	An adiabatic process is any process occurring without gain or loss of heat within a system. Assess the environments in which isothermal processes typically occur. Adiabatic processes can occur if the container of the system has thermally-insulated walls or the process happens in an extremely short time.
3810	This sort of compression is called adiabatic. [Incidentally, this use of the term âadiabaticâ has nothing to do with an adiabatic process in quantum mechanics and, in fact, the meaning is almost the opposite.
3811	Adiabatic cooling is used in evaporative coolers. An evaporative cooler is basically a large fan that draws warm air through water-moistened pads. As the water in the pads evaporates, the air is chilled and pushed out to the room. The temperature can be controlled by adjusting the airflow of the cooler.
3812	1 For an adiabatically expanding ideal monatomic gas which does work on its environment (W is positive), internal energy of the gas should decrease.  In a sense, isothermal process can be considered as the opposite extreme of adiabatic process. In isothermal processes, heat exchange is slow enough so that the system's temperature remains constant.
3813	Occurring without gain or loss of heat. When a gas is compressed under adiabatic conditions, its pressure increases and its temperature rises without the gain or loss of any heat. Conversely, when a gas expands under adiabatic conditions, its pressure and temperature both decrease without the gain or loss of heat. The adiabatic cooling of air as it rises in the atmosphere is the main cause of cloud formation.
3814	The temperature falls at the adiabatic rate in unsaturated air till the base of the cumulus cloud is reached. Higher than this, the temperature decreases at a fairly uniform rate, but more slowly than the adiabatic rate. At the same time the utmost pains are taken to maintain the adiabatic condition of the metal walls.
3815	Adiabatic cooling is the process of reducing heat through a change in air pressure caused by volume expansion. In data centers and other facilities, adiabatic processes have enabled free cooling methods, which use freely available natural phenomena to regulate temperature. The principle of adiabatic cooling has been harnessed to develop cooling units that can save industry millions of liters of water.
3816	1 Adiabatic processes can occur if the container of the system has thermally-insulated walls or the process happens in an extremely short time.  For an adiabatically expanding ideal monatomic gas which does work on its environment (W is positive), internal energy of the gas should decrease.
3817	In contrast, an adiabatic process is where a system exchanges no heat with its surroundings (Q = 0). (See our atom on Adiabatic Process. ) In other words, in an isothermal process, the value Î´T = 0 but Q â  0, while in an adiabatic process, Î´T â  0 but Q = 0.

3838	Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy, normally from the Sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organisms' activities.arbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation. Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction, so photosynthesis needs to supply both a source of energy to drive this process, and the electrons needed to convert carbon dioxide into a carbohydrate.

The iris works like a shutter in a camera. It has the ability to enlarge and shrink, depending on how much light is entering the eye.ight rays pass through a dense, transparent gel-like substance, called the vitreous that fills the globe of the eyeball and helps the eye hold its spherical shape. In a normal eye, the light rays come to a sharp focusing point on the retina. The retina functions much like the film in a camera.

3848	Nuclear fusion research has been a mild success in terms of international cooperation, with a growing number of countries determined to contribute their own piece of the puzzle. Today, there are nuclear fusion experiments operating in the U.S., Germany, United Kingdom, India, France, Japan and several other countries.
3849	Latin for âthe way,â ITER will be the largest and most powerful fusion generator in the world, and is expected to to cross the break-even point. ITER is projected to produce 500 MW of power with an input of 50 MW, and be able to hold plasma for half an hour or more.
3850	WHAT IS FUSION? Fusion is the process that powers the sun and the stars. It is the reaction in which two atoms of hydrogen combine together, or fuse, to form an atom of helium.
3851	Fusion, at its core, is a simple concept. Take two hydrogen isotopes and smash them together with overwhelming force. The two atoms overcome their natural repulsion and fuse, yielding a reaction that produces an enormous amount of energy.
3852	what is fusion? Fusion is the process that powers the sun and the stars. It is the reaction in which two atoms of hydrogen combine together, or fuse, to form an atom of helium. In the process some of the mass of the hydrogen is converted into energy. The easiest fusion reaction to make happen is combining deuterium (or âheavy hydrogen) with tritium (or âheavy-heavy hydrogenâ) to make helium and a neutron. Deuterium is plentifully available in ordinary water. Tritium can be produced by combining the fusion neutron with the abundant light metal lithium.

3854	Currently, the largest fusion reactor in the world is the Joint European Torus (JET), a tokamak based in England and supported by the European Union. JET was commissioned in the 1970s and first came online in 1983 and successfully produced plasma, the first step in achieving fusion.
3855	Every fusion is energy consuming and part of the energy is bound in the created core. Cracking neutrons gives the energy back. The fusion is a energy consuming byproduct. It is a waste of the process, which is fission not fusion. Fusion reactors will never produce energy because they consume more energy! They are not real fusion reactors! Its fission!
3856	While fusion is a nuclear process, the products of the fusion reaction (helium and a neutron) are not radioactive, and with proper design a fusion power plant would be passively safe, and would produce no long-lived radioactive waste.

3858	1 Approximately 36,000 units of red blood cells are needed every day in the U.S. 2  Nearly 7,000 units of platelets and 10,000 units of plasma are needed daily in the U.S. 3  Nearly 21 million blood components are transfused each year in the U.S.  The average red blood cell transfusion is approximately 3 pints.
3859	The 2015/16 price of red cells is detailed in the notes. Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding accounts for 70,000 hospital admissions per year and 11% of all red blood cell units transfused in England. It is the single leading clinical indication for transfusions for red blood cells. However there is no clear optimum threshold for the use of red blood cell transfusions.
3860	The average adult has 8 â 12 pints of blood traveling all over his or her body through the heart, lungs, arteries, veins and capillaries. Blood is an essential part of our bodies that transports oxygen, nutrients, and metabolic waste. In addition to all that, blood performs these functions:
3861	Blood is a living tissue composed of blood cells suspended in plasma. The cellular elements, red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets â make up about 45% of the volume of whole blood. Plasma, which is 92% water, makes up the remaining 55%.
3862	A reduction in red blood cell transfusion for AUIGIB would have substantial financial implications. In 2013-14, an estimated 204,000 units of red blood cells were issued for AUGIB, costing Â£123.31 per unit. A 13% reduction, as shown in this trial, would lead to annual savings to the NHS of about Â£3.3m for the blood alone, which excludes laboratory and administration costs.
3863	1 The average adult has about 10 pints of blood in his body. Roughly 1 pint is given during a donation. 2  A healthy donor may donate red blood cells every 56 days, or double red cells every 112 days.  A healthy donor may donate platelets as few as 7 days apart, but a maximum of 24 times a year.
3864	Whole blood units are usually around a pint or a bit over 450 mL Packed blood cells are usually around a half pint. According to the FAQ on the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center web site, a unit is one pint, which equals about 473 mL. Approximately 450mL according to Canadian Blood Services. This depends on various factors and the volume of blood in each unit bag will not always be the same from one bag to another.
3865	A unit of whole blood is 450 milliliters, which is about 0.9510 U.S. pint. Forâ¦ components of blood, one unit is the amount of that substance that would normally be found in one unit of whole blood. The adult human body contains roughly 12 units of whole blood.   See the related link for more information.
3866	If all blood donors gave two to four times a year, it would help prevent blood shortages. 17. You could donate 48 gallons of blood if you began at 17 years old and donate every 56 days until you reach 76 years old.

3948	WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Urethral stent placement is a procedure to open a blockage or stricture (narrowing) in your urethra with a stent. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from your bladder out of your body. A stent is a small plastic or metal tube that is used to open your narrowed urethra. Blockages and strictures can make it hard for urine to flow out of your body. Pelvic (hip) injuries and repeat urinary tract infections may lead to urethral strictures and blockages.
3949	A catheter (thin tube) with a balloon attached may be placed over the wire. The balloon on the catheter will be inflated to widen your narrowed urethra. The stent will be put into your urethra, over the wire, to the area of the blockage. Once the stent is in place, the wire and catheter will be removed. An x-ray may be done to check if the stent is in the proper place inside your urethra.
3950	A âureteral stentâ or âureteric stentâ is a thin, hollow tube inserted into the ureter. Ureters are thin tube-like-organs which connect kidneys to the urinary bladder, to allow urine flow from the kidney. The stent is longer than the actual ureter and tube-ends are usually coiled.
3951	What is it? A thin, hollow tube placed inside the ureter during surgery to ensure drainage of urine from the kidney into the bladder. J shaped curls are present at both ends to hold the tube in place and prevent migration, hence the description double J stent. It allows the kidney to drain urine by temporarily relieving any obstruction, or to assist the kidney in passing out stone fragments into the bladder after definitive kidney stone treatment.
3952	This topic will discuss the indications for ureteral stenting, technique of ureteral stent placement, management of stents, and stent complications. The management of urinary obstruction and urinary tract infection are discussed in detail elsewhere. Ureteral stents are functionally used to re-establish or maintain the patency of the ureter.
3953	Urethral stent placement is a procedure to open a blockage or stricture (narrowing) of your urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from your bladder out of your body. A stent is a small plastic or metal tube used to open your narrowed urethra.
3954	Patients with complicated obstruction need prompt decompression of the urinary tract with either placement of an indwelling ureteral stent or a percutaneous nephrostomy tube [7-9]. Retrograde ureteral stent placement and percutaneous nephrostomy both effectively relieve obstruction and infection due to ureteral calculi.
3955	A ureteric stent is a fine plastic tube inserted into your kidney. It allows urine to drain from your kidney into your bladder when you have a blockage - a stone or growth - in your ureter (a narrow, muscular tube that connects your kidney to your bladder).
3956	It can be blocked within ureter. Blockage such as a stone can hinder the urine flow from kidneys to bladder. Some disease process such as infection, scar or tumour in the wall of ureter can obstruct the lumen of ureter. In other cases, any mass or swelling in side abdomen/pelvis can compress the ureter from outside.
3957	â¢ The stent may irritate your bladder causing you to feel a need to pass urine frequently. â¢ You may see blood in your urine on some occasions. Sometimes you may feel pain in your back (on the side of your body where the stent is) when passing urine. This is usual as the stent may rub against the wall of your ureter.

3989	About 200 million years ago, the supercontinent began to break up. Gondwana (what is now Africa, South America, Antarctica, India and Australia) first split from Laurasia (Eurasia and North America). Then about 150 million years ago, Gondwana broke up.
3990	German climatologist and geophysicist who, in 1915, published as expanded version of his 1912 book The Origin of Continents and Oceans. This work was one of the first to suggest continental drift and plate tectonics. He suggested that a supercontinent he called Pangaea had existed in the past, broke up starting 200 million years ago, and that the pieces drifted to their present positions.
3991	Plate Tectonics is the latest theory of how our planet came to be. This modern day theory is also incorrect. New objective research dating the Earthâs ocean basin formation and growth patterns (shown below) does not support Plate Tectonicsâ version of Pangaea and its separation.

This major circulatory system is called the systemic circulation. The circulation of blood through the fetus bypasses the pulmonary circuit (see also fetal circulation).
4019	The term dressing refers to the material that is placed directly over the wound. The dressing absorbs some of the blood and helps a clot to form. The clot plugs the wound to stop the bleeding. The dressing also protects the wound from additional contamination and injury.
4020	The heart. and the blood vessels are the most important parts of the circulatory system. The heart is a central. organ in the circulatory system. With each beat it forces blood into the blood vessels which. transport or carry oxygen and nutrients to all of the tissues and organs (the arteries) of the body and.
4021	Thrombosis and blood clots. One of the more extreme circulation problems is called thrombosis. Lack of movement in certain areas can result in blood clots which can become serious. Blood clots are also known as thrombosis, from the Greek word from âthrombosâ meaning a clot. Exercise helps the circulation flowing and speeds it up.
4022	If blood continues to seep from the dressing after you have secured the dressing, applied manual pressure, and elevated the wound (if applicable), you should apply a pressure dressing. The objective of applying a pressure dressing is to stop the bleeding, not to stop all blood circulation below the wound.
4023	In normal circulation, the oxygenated blood leaves the left side of the heart through very large. arteries. It flows through smaller and smaller and even smaller arteries arterioles and capillaries. until it reaches the tissues and organs where the blood vessels are very small usually requiring a. microscope to see them.
4024	They stick to the walls in the area and each other, changing shape to form a plug that fills in the broken part to stop blood from leaking out. When activated, platelets also release chemicals to attract more platelets and other cells, and to set off the next step. 2. The clot grows.
4025	Arterial System. Blood pumped from the left side of the heart enters the aorta, the main arterial trunk of the systemic circulation. The aorta, which is about 1 inch in diameter, arches upward and toward the left side of the body. Just above the heart two coronary arteries branch off from the aorta.
4026	Blood clots are healthy and lifesaving when they stop bleeding. But they can also form when they aren't needed and cause a heart attack, stroke, or other serious medical problems. The life cycle of a normal blood clot depends on a series of chemical interactions. 1. Platelets form a plug.
4027	If the pressure dressing controls the bleeding, proceed to check the casualty for other injuries. Recheck the circulation below the pressure dressing periodically and monitor the casualty for shock (Lesson 8). If the wound continues to bleed, apply a tourniquet as described in the following paragraphs. 4-7.
4028	Safeopedia explains Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) Noise Reduction Rating is used to evaluate and determine the effictiveness or fit of noise protection equipment for a given work environment. NRR is specifically the measurement, in decibles, of how well hearing protection reduces noise as specified by the Environmental Protection Agency.
4029	NRR STANDS FOR NOISE REDUCTION RATING.

4033	Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) is the difference between the overall C-weighted sound level of a noise spectrum having equal energy per octave and the resulting A-weighted noise levels under a hearing protection device.
4034	Noise Reduction Rating â NRR. Hearing loss affects nearly one in ten Americans. This condition is usually caused by exposure to excessive noise. Shooting firearms is one of the activities that expose individuals to excessive noise. The noise levels that are produced when firearms are used can lead to permanent hearing loss. This makes it necessary to use hearing protection with good noise reduction rating.
4035	This means that if you are firing a rifle that produces 140 dB and the hearing protection that you have on has an NRR 33 dB, the level of noise exposure is not reduced to 103 dB. To determine how much noise exposure is reduce, deduct 7 from the NRR on the device and divide the result by two.
4036	The following summary explains the rating numbers seen on Howard LeightÂ® packaging: NRR [Noise Reduction Rating] â This rating is used in the United States, and is accepted for use in a variety of other countries. The current range of NRRs available in the U.S. market extends from 0 to 33 decibels.

4058	Psychology definition for Anchoring Heuristic in normal everyday language, edited by psychologists, professors and leading students. Help us get better.
4059	Anchoring Heuristic. The Anchoring Heuristic, also know as focalism, refers to the human tendency to accept and rely on, the first piece of information received before making a decision. That first piece of information is the anchor and sets the tone for everything that follows.
4060	A heuristic technique, often called simply a heuristic, is any approach to problem solving, learning, or discovery that employs a practical method not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals. Where finding an optimal solution is impossible or impractical, heuristic methods can be used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution. Heuristics can be mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making a decision. Examples of this method include
4061	The study of heuristics in human decision-making was developed in the 1970s and 80s by Israeli psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, although the concept was originally introduced by Nobel laureate Herbert A. Simon.
4062	(Redirected from Hueristic) A heuristic technique (/hjuËËrÉªstÉªk/; Ancient Greek: Îµá½ÏÎ¯ÏÎºÏ, find or discover), often called simply a heuristic, is any approach to problem solving, learning, or discovery that employs a practical method not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals.

4064	3 Examples of The Anchoring Rule in Marketing. In 1974 cognitive psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky identified what is known as the âanchoring heuristic.â A heuristic is essentially a mental shortcut or rule of thumb the brain uses to simplify complex problems in order to make decisions (also known as a cognitive bias). The anchoring rule of thumb describes the common human tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the âanchorâ) when making decisions. Once the anchor is set, decisions are then made by adjusting around the initial anchor number, regardless of the legitimacy of the actual anchor number.
4065	Gerd Gigerenzer focused on the fast and frugal properties of heuristics, i.e., using heuristics in a way that is principally accurate and thus eliminating most cognitive bias. Heuristics â like the recognition heuristic or the take-the-best heuristic â are viewed as special tools that tackle specific tasks (e.g., binary choice) under conditions of uncertainty and are organized in an adaptive toolbox.
4066	Anchoring Heuristic The Anchoring Heuristic, also know as focalism, refers to the human tendency to accept and rely on, the first piece of information received before making a decision. That first piece of information is the anchor and sets the tone for everything that follows. For example, a car dealer might suggest a price for a car and the customer will try to negotiate down from that price, even if the price suggested is more than the Blue Book Value.
4067	Anchoring or focalism is a cognitive bias that describes the common human tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the anchor) when making decisions. During decision making, anchoring occurs when individuals use an initial piece of information to make subsequent judgments. Once an anchor is set, other judgments are made by adjusting away from that anchor, and there is a bias toward interpreting other information around the anchor.

4126	Staghorn Fern Care: How To Water, Grow and Care for Mounted Staghorn Ferns January 27 2015 152 Comments. Itâs a fact: staghorn ferns are stunning. Mounted on a board, wrapped in vintage burlap, and hung a wall, these plants are truly works of living art.
4127	Here are a few pointers about their care: 1  Most ferns like an evenly moist soil with regular waterings. 2  Bushy ferns can be difficult to water. 3  Bathrooms and kitchens are good environments for ferns because of all the running water.  Help maintain moisture levels by using double containers for your ferns.
4128	Tip: It's actually a good idea to repot a large fern, especially if it is pot bound, unless you want to water all the time. The correct soil mix is essential to the health of the plant, too. To make a potting mixture suitable for Boston ferns, combine equal parts of peat moss, sand, and garden soil.
4129	Most ferns like an evenly moist soil with regular waterings. Allowing the soil to dry out between waterings stresses these plants. Bushy ferns can be difficult to water. Try using a watering can with a long spout to direct the water to the center of the plant. Water generously, until it drains out of the bottom of the pot. Bathrooms and kitchens are good environments for ferns because of all the running water.
4130	What it needs: Place it in bright, indirect light or partial shade and well-drained soil. Feed once a month with a water-soluble fertilizer such as 20-20-20. Key to success: Display âTigerâ fern in a location where it wonât get too hot, such as in the cool shade of a deep porch. Good drainage is critical as well.
4131	A good rule of thumb is to water once per week in dry, hot times of year, and once every two to three weeks during cooler months. Start with this schedule, and adjust as necessary depending on your space. Staghorn ferns absorb water through their fronds, as well as their roots.
4132	During the hot months of summer, an indoor Boston fern on a table or stand can be placed on a saucer filled with stones and water. As the water evaporates, humidity is naturally provided to the plant. Simply fill a plant saucer with gravel, and then add water, stopping just below the top of the gravel.
4133	Although the fern isnât difficult to grow, it tends to shed its leaves if it doesnât receive plenty of bright light. Watering a Boston fern isnât rocket science, but understanding how much and how often to water Boston ferns requires a bit of practice and careful attention. Too much or too little water are both detrimental to the plant. Letâs learn more about Boston fern irrigation.
4134	Watering and Feeding. In warmer months during the growing season, provide your Boston fern with enough tepid water to keep the soil evenly moist, but not saturated. Water it more frequently during the hottest months of summer, and try not to let the soil become dry before watering.
4135	Water only when soil is just dry to the touch. 1  If leaves turn yellow and soil is wet 1 to 2 inches beneath the surface, you are watering too much. 2  Ferns love humidity and appreciate an occasional misting. 3  Never fertilize a fernâor any plantâthat is too dry; it can burn the roots.
4136	A: A high absolute neutrophil count may indicate inflammation, infection, stress, reaction to medication or the presence of cancer, according to HealthTap contributor Dr. Reid Blackwelder. In most instances, levels above 8,000 per cubic millimeter are considered abnormally high, though this varies on the age and health of the patient.
4137	Monocytes: 2% to 8%. Eosinophils: 1% to 4%. Basophils: 0.5% to 1%. Band: 0% to 3%. Elevated Total leukocytic count can occur in different condition like infections (bacterial, viral or fungal), systemic disease (e.g.inflamtory bowel diseases and vasculitis), physical stress, cancer especially hematologic malignancies.
4138	Transient elevation of the white blood cells is not warning but should be properly approached. Serial CBC follow up is essential. On the other hand, persistent elevation in the white blood cell count should be investigated properly to exclude both chronic systemic inflammatory conditions and malignancy.

4141	I have recently changed dr's looking for someone not so eager to pass out pills for anxiety. My dr. looked at some old blood tests I took to him and ordered a repeat. My CBC came back with high WBC of 14.1, high neutrophils of 9.6 and high leukocytes of 3.57.

4143	Quick Answer. A high absolute neutrophil count may indicate inflammation, infection, stress, reaction to medication or the presence of cancer, according to HealthTap contributor Dr. Reid Blackwelder. In most instances, levels above 8,000 per cubic millimeter are considered abnormally high, though this varies on the age and health of the patient.
4144	High white blood count could be caused by an infection, inflammation, allergies, asthma, leukemia, severe stress, or tissue death. High absolute neutrophilis could be caused by an acute bacterial infection, inflammation, stress, inflammation, and certain leukemia's. High red cell distribution width could be caused by mixed rbc's. High white blood count could be caused by an infection, inflammation, allergies, asthma, leukemia, severe stress, or tissue death.
4145	Smoking is well documented to increase the white cell count especially neutrophils. Although a higher than 11,000 white cells/mcl of blood is considered high, in leukemias the white blood cell counts can reach 100,000. An elevated ESR, LDH or CRP would be helpful and would make inflammatory changes more likely although not conclusive.
4146	He didn't ejaculate and he hadn't within the previous two days. Now, I am two days late and I am feeling bloated, and irritable, no other symptoms really. Usually, I vary a couple of days from when I think my period will come, but for some reason I tend to freak out when I any days late from the previous month.
4147	Seasonique is an extended regimen pill that offers the convenience of only 4 periods a year. A woman's body is used to having 13 periods a year but when you are on the pill you can skip your period b/c it is only withdrawal bleeding caused by removing the hormones and taking a placebo pill(usually for 7 days).
4148	Seasonique and LoSeasonique work just like any traditional birth control pill. The biggest difference is that these are extended cycle pills, so each pill packs come with a 3 month supply of pills. You take one pill every day for 3 months.
4149	My period is going on four days late. My last period was on 8/8/08 my periods are pretty normal. I took two pregnancy test and they came out negative, I'm really worried that I could be pregnant. I had cramps and breast sourness all last week and now its gone.
4150	Women typically begin getting their periods anywhere from age 10 to 15. During the first two years after starting your period, your hormones may still be adjusting. This can cause late or missed periods. Menopause generally begins between ages 45 to 55. As your body goes through the transition, your normal cycle can become irregular.
4151	27 out of 28 found this helpful. In both of my pregnancies, I took tests 1 - 2 days after my missed periods which both turned out negative. I waited about 3 more days both times and then each turned out positive. I guess it just depends on your hormones... by now, you should be fine trying another test. When in doubt, see your doctor.
4152	I am on my 2nd week of Seasonique--and began it because I had some terrible PMS symptoms for the past 3 months. I also get migraines, and in that 3 month period, I was getting tons of migraines during the 14 day (or so) time frame before my period was due to start.
4153	have Missed my period for 2 weeks, i feel nauseated in the morning , i have pain at my lower back ,also i have new pain under my abdomen , i had slight spotting before i Missed my period ,i start to urinate alot lately , i feel lazy alot . i made home test at Saturday and it was negative . now my period late 2 weeks ..
4154	I've been on Seasonique for 6 weeks and after the first 25 days, my period started (within three days of when it normally would have) and it hasn't stopped, but the bleeding became very, very light after 5 days of the normal heavy bleeding, but cramping was much, much less than what I normally experienced.
4155	Most women usually have a period every 28 days between starting their period and menopause. However, a healthy menstrual cycle can range from every 21 to 35 days. If your period doesnât fall within these ranges, it could be because of one of these reasons.
4156	If the faucet still leaks after tightening the packing nut, the washer on the end of the valve stem needs to be replaced. 1  Turn the water off at the water meter using a cut-off key. 2  Unscrew the packing nut beneath the handle of the faucet.  Grasp the faucet handle, and pull the valve stem out of the hose bibb.
4157	Leaks in outdoor faucets usually occur in two places â the handle and the spout. Handle - Try tightening the packing nut with a wrench. If that fails to stop the leak, youâll have to remove the faucetâs valve stem assembly. See steps below.
4158	1 If that fails, replace the packing. 2  If the faucet leaks from the spout, either a washer is defective or a valve seat is badly corroded.  To find out which side needs work, turn off the shutoff valves one at a time; the leak will stop when one or the other is turned off.
4159	Leaking Compression Faucets. If your faucet has separate hot and cold water handles, it's probably a compression faucet (also called a stem or washer faucet). In this faucet, a rubber seat washer is secured to the stem, which has very coarse threads on the outside.
4160	When you turn the handle to shut off the faucet, the stem is screwed down, compressing the washer against the valve seat in the faucet body. The stem is secured by a packing nut, which compresses the packing (twine, a washer, or an O-ring) and prevents water from leaking around the stem. 1  If water leaks around the handle, tighten the packing nut.  If the faucet leaks from the spout, either a washer is defective or a valve seat is badly corroded.
4161	Leaks in outdoor faucets usually occur in two places â the handle and the spout. 1  Handle - Try tightening the packing nut with a wrench.  Spout - Youâll have to remove the valve stem assembly from your faucet to fix a leak coming from the spout.
4162	If the faucet still leaks after tightening the packing nut, the washer on the end of the valve stem needs to be replaced. Hereâs how to go about it: 1  Turn the water off at the water meter using a cut-off key.  Unscrew the packing nut beneath the handle of the faucet.
4163	1 Turn on the faucet to drain the water from the faucet. 2  Remove the handle by unscrewing the screw that holds it in place.  Behind the handle, youâll find a packing nut. Turning counter-clockwise, use a wrench to undo the packing nut and slide out the valve assembly.
4164	1 Turn on the faucet to drain the water from the faucet. 2  Remove the handle by unscrewing the screw that holds it in place. 3  Behind the handle, youâll find a packing nut.

4196	The cause of uncontrolled cell growth in the pituitary gland, which creates a tumor, remains unknown. The pituitary gland is a small, bean-shaped gland situated at the base of your brain, somewhat behind your nose and between your ears. Despite its small size, the gland influences nearly every part of your body.
4197	This depends on the type of tumor and the size of the tumor. A large tumor may cause loss of vision, particularly peripheral vision, if it compresses the optic chiasm (where the optic [eye] nerves come together, located above the pituitary gland).
4198	Surgery for Pituitary Tumors. Pituitary tumor surgery involves removing all or most of the tumor that's growing on your pituitary gland. But what type of surgery you have depends on the type of pituitary tumor you have, as well as the tumor's size and shape. Surgery is typically needed for 2 reasons: If the tumor is pressing on your optic nerves, which can potentially lead to blindness.
4199	Large pituitary tumors â those measuring about 1 centimeter (slightly less than a half-inch) or larger â are known as macroadenomas. Smaller tumors are called microadenomas. Because of the size of macroadenomas, they can put pressure on the normal pituitary gland and nearby structures.
4200	Surgery is the removal of the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue during an operation. It is the most common treatment for a pituitary gland tumor. Surgery, which is performed by a surgical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating a tumor using surgery, is often successful in removing the entire tumor. About 95% of surgeries to remove pituitary gland tumors are done by the transsphenoidal route.
4201	If a pituitary tumor is overproducing a hormone, there are medications that can help. The drugs bromocriptine (Parlodel) and cabergoline (Dostinex) are used to treat tumors that secrete prolactin. Octreotide (Sandostatin) or pegvisomant (Somavert) can be used to treat tumors that make growth hormone.
4202	Pituitary Tumor. Pituitary Tumor: Endoscopic Procedure Revolutionizes Pituitary Surgery. One of the most extraordinary advances pioneered at the Skull Base Institute is the minimally invasive, fully endoscopic approach to treating pituitary tumors (pituitary adenomas) and other skull base disorders.
4203	Not all pituitary tumors cause symptoms. Pituitary tumors that make hormones (functioning) can cause a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the hormone they produce. The signs and symptoms of pituitary tumors that don't make hormones (nonfunctioning) are related to their growth and the pressure they put on other structures.
4204	The pituitary gland is NOT in the brain and pituitary tissue is different from brain tissue. Since the pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain and is connected to the brain by a thin stalk, there is often confusion, particularly by insurance companies, about the classification of a pituitary tumor.
4205	Complete removal of a tumor is the desired goal. However, a minority of patients with pituitary tumor will have a recurrence of the tumor. Approximately 16% of patients with a non functioning tumor will have a tumor recurrence within 10 years and 10% require additional treatment (surgery, pituitary radiation).
4206	All vehicles registered in the UK must have a unique, stamped-in vehicle identification number (.
4207	A Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a set of unique digits that relate to specific information about your vehicle (1981 or newer).
4208	The 4th to 8th positions in the VIN are the vehicle descriptor section or VDS. This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle type, and may include information on the automobile platform used, the model, and the body style.

4216	An encounter between at least one of humanity's ancestors and a saber-toothed tiger has been preserved for the ages, according to German researchers. And that meeting bears every indication of what one might expect -- violence.
4217	Smilodon is a sit-and-wait predator and it only pounces when its prey is close enough. The structure of the bones tells us that saber tooth cat could roar in the same way as present day cats do. They used to fight over mates. The upper canines of the saber tooth tiger are 30 cm (12 inches).
4218	The giants of the ice age such as elephant-sized sloths and sabre-toothed tigers were pushed into extinction within 100 years by a double whammy of warming and hunting by man. They once roamed the windswept plains of Patagonia in the southern tip of South America along with humans.
4219	And, in this case, they look to have come in handy. Archaeologists found saber-tooth bones alongside the spears and stone tools at the ancient embankment. The find is an early indication that earliest humans were using weapons against animals of prey. And it suggests they had violent clashes with the great cat -- an animal believed to have died off some 12,000 years ago.
4220	Species such as the South American horse, giant jaguar and sabre-toothed cat, and the enormous one-tonne short-faced bear (the largest land-based mammalian carnivore) were found widely across Patagonia, but seemed to disappear shortly after humans arrived.

4221	Reason behind sabre toothed tiger ice age extinction revealed The tigers roamed the windswept plains of Patagonia in the southern tip of South America before their extinction 12,000 years ago Share
4222	Full Answer. Perhaps the most well known saber-toothed cat is the Smilodon, often referred to as the saber-toothed tiger. Smilodon's territory extended across North and South America, although they are often associated with the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, where thousands of intact remains have been found.
4223	It is highly likely that humans were confronted by saber-toothed cats at the SchÃ¶ningen lakeside, a University of TÃ¼bingen press release reads. In that case, all the human could do was grab his up to 2.3 metres long spear and defend himself..
4224	This overlap may be partially to blame for the saber-toothed cats' disappearance. Early humans may have hunted the saber-toothed cats' primary prey to the point of extinction. It is also likely that the saber-toothed cats were hunted themselves as they continued to encounter growing populations of early humans.
4225	Saber-Toothed Tigers And Humans Met About 300,000 Years Ago At SchÃ¶ningen In Present-Day Germany. Walk With Beasts exhibition, Horniman Museum, London. The Smilodon is also colloquially known as Saber-toothed cat or Saber-toothed tiger. The Smilodon is the prehistoric cat that is best known to researchers. In truth, all modern day cats, including tigers, came from a completely different line.
4226	Ground-source or water-source heat pumps can be used in more extreme climates than air-source heat pumps, and customer satisfaction with the systems is very high. A new type of heat pump for residential systems is the absorption heat pump, also called a gas-fired heat pump.bsorption heat pumps use heat as their energy source, and can be driven with a wide variety of heat sources. For more information on these specific types of heat pumps, go to: 1  Air-Source Heat Pumps. 2  Ductless Mini-Split Heat Pumps. 3  Geothermal Heat Pumps.
4227	Types of Heat Pumps. The most popular type of heat pump is an air-to-air heat pump, or air-source heat hump (ASHP). These are often mounted to the interior of a wall and used mostly in moderate climates, as performance can lag when temperatures get below 35 degrees Fahrenheit. heat pump is equipment that uses a refrigerant to move heat from one place to another. During the summer, a heat pump captures heat from inside a home and transfers it to the outdoor air through a condensing unit.
4228	All-electric furnaces have AFUE ratings of 95 percent to 100 percent, but they are not economical is many parts of the country. You can also consider electric heat pumps to heat or cool parts or all of your home. Some heat pumps can be added onto furnaces as well, to help use less gas or propane.Radiant floors, or hydronic heating systems, often use piping under a floor.ll-electric furnaces have AFUE ratings of 95 percent to 100 percent, but they are not economical is many parts of the country.

4230	One great way to get more efficient heating and cooling in your home is with a heat pump. But don't think heat pumps are just for heating. Many can be used for both heating and air conditioning. In fact, many ductless mini-split air conditioning units also operate as heat pumps.A heat pump is equipment that uses a refrigerant to move heat from one place to another.During the summer, a heat pump captures heat from inside a home and transfers it to the outdoor air through a condensing unit. heat pump is equipment that uses a refrigerant to move heat from one place to another. During the summer, a heat pump captures heat from inside a home and transfers it to the outdoor air through a condensing unit.
4231	In most American households, heating is provided by one of two types of HVAC systems: a heat pump or a furnace. Both types of heating systems are effective and reliable.he heat pump contains a set of coils in the indoor unit and another in the outdoor unit. When the system is providing heating, the refrigerant in the outdoor coils is evaporated into a gas, which absorbs heat.
4232	Hybrid Heat Split System. A Carrier hybrid heat split system is a more energy-efficient variation of the traditional heating and air conditioning split system. The inclusion of a heat pump allows the option of electricity-fueled heating and air conditioning, in addition to gas furnace heat.VAC System Types. There are 4 primary types of heating and. cooling systems: split systems, hybrid heat split systems, duct-free split systems and packaged systems.

4234	The combustion fuel half of the system could be propane, natural gas, oil, or even coal and wood. In comparison with a combustion fuel-fired furnace or standard heat pump alone, this type of system is also economical. Actual energy savings depend on the relative costs of the combustion fuel relative to electricity.bsorption heat pumps use heat as their energy source, and can be driven with a wide variety of heat sources.

4235	Refrigerators and air-conditioning systems are really just one-way heat pumps (or a half-heat pump). Because they move heat rather than generate heat, heat pumps can provide up to four times the amount of energy they consume in electricity, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. heat pump is equipment that uses a refrigerant to move heat from one place to another. During the summer, a heat pump captures heat from inside a home and transfers it to the outdoor air through a condensing unit.
4236	What are nucleic acids made of? A nucleotide contains three components: a phosphate group, a sugar and a nitrogenous base. The phosphate group and sugar are bonded together to make the backbone portion of a nucleic acid. In DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose; in RNA, the sugar is ribose.
4237	DNA and its close relative RNA are perhaps the most important molecules in biology. They contains the instructions that make every single living organism on the planet. DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid and RNA for ribonucleic acid. They are polymers (long chain molecules) made from nucleotides.
4238	DNA is the genetic material, and genes are made of DNA. DNA therefore has two essential functions: replication and expression. Replication means that the DNA, with all its genes, must be copied every time a cell divides.
4239	DNA is the genetic material, and genes are made of DNA. DNA therefore has two essential functions: replication and expression. 1  Replication means that the DNA, with all its genes, must be copied every time a cell divides.  Expression means that the genes on DNA must control characteristics.
4240	What do DNA and RNA have in common? A nucleotide contains three components: a phosphate group, a sugar and a nitrogenous base. The phosphate group and sugar are bonded together to make the backbone portion of a nucleic acid. In DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose; in RNA, the sugar is ribose.
4241	Long chains of nucleotides are called nucleic acids. Two types of nucleic acids are found in organisms: deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid. DNA consists of two nucleotide chains bonded to and wrapped around one another in a twisted ladder shape called a double helix.
4242	The image in the center shows the structure of DNA. Note that there are two strands: one shown in blue, one in yellow. Other examples of a helix include yarn, a phone cord, or a spiral staircase. Each chain of the double helix is made up of repeating units called nucleotides. A single nucleotide is composed of three functional groups: a sugar, a triphosphate, and a nitrogenous (nitrogen-containing) base, as shown below.
4243	What are the elements of nucleic acids? A nucleotide contains three components: a phosphate group, a sugar and a nitrogenous base. The phosphate group and sugar are bonded together to make the backbone portion of a nucleic acid. In DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose; in RNA, the sugar is ribose.
4244	Nucleotides and the double helix. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the heritable material found in all cells. DNA provides the instructions to build, maintain, and regulate cells and organisms and is passed on when cells divide and when organisms reproduce.
4245	DNA is made of repeating units called nucleotides. The four nucleotides in DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. Adenine binds with thymine, and guanine binds with cytosine.
4246	After menopause, women can experience a shrinkage of their fibroid tumors. Menopause means that the reproductive hormones, including estrogen, are decreasing; because fibroid tumors thrive on estrogen, this means the tumors will decrease in size.
4247	Fibroid tumors are sensitive to changes in a woman's monthly hormone cycle. As estrogen levels tend to increase before menopause starts, many uterine fibroids start to grow. This may make the symptoms worse. After menopause, estrogen falls dramatically.
4248	What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Uterine Fibroids After Menopause? Fibroid tumors, which are generally noncancerous growths in and/or around the uterus, can still cause significant issues for a woman's health after menopause; her general, as well as gynecological, health can be affected. Fibroid tumors, although bothersome, are usually not dangerous. Fibroid tumors can cause pelvic pain and pain during intercourse.
4249	Uterine fibroids are tumors that are not cancerous that grow on or in the muscles of the uterus (womb). They are sometimes called myoma, leiomyoma, leiomyomata and fibromyoma. All women are at risk of developing fibroids at some point in their lives. They are the most common tumor of the female reproductive system.
4250	Every womanâs body is different though. Menopause may not cause the fibroids to shrink at all, and they may even continue growing. Some women have continued to experience painful symptoms from fibroids after menopause.
4251	Some of the uterine fibroid symptoms that may still persist after menopause include: 1  Pelvic pressure: You may continue to experience severe pain similar to cramps before a period.  Urinary urgency: If the fibroids are pushing on the bladder, it can cause you to have to urinate frequently.
